They're such a nice escape from all the other chain sub restaurants, ESPECIALLY Subway, which I'm growing to detest.  This one recently went thru an ownership change but the staff is just as friendly as the original, so no worries there (or w/the quality of food).\n\nWhen you first order a \"regular\" sub & see the bread they whip out you think, \"wow, that's nothing special\" (in comparison to other places)...but that's before they start PILING on the meat and toppings!  The good folks at Lenny's do NOT skimp on those.  That underwhelming bread loaf very quickly becomes a heaping mass of goodness that will quench most any appetite.  I took my dad here once & he scoffed at the beginnings of his 'samich until he saw the finished product...and could barely finish it (and he can pack away some food!).  \n\nJust came home with a regular turkey on wheat (and they have excellent wheat bread btw), and it was only $6.94 w/tax.  For only about $1.50 or $2 more you can make it a meal - but I'm TRYING to be healthy so I opted for water at home (insert grimace here cuz they have really good sweet tea). Basically the same thing you'd pay at Subway for miniscule toppings on a 6\" sandwich. \n\nLenny's reg sub is 7.5\" and twice the size of Subway toppings-wise, and their large is twice that at FIFTEEN inches!  They also have a good selection of salads, as well as hot subs like Philly Cheesesteaks.  Oh, and they also have these \"grilled footlong hot dogs,\" BUT BEWARE - they aren't your ordinary hot dogs, they're more like these ENORMOUS sausages & they're rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they're like five/six bucks or something like that).  \n\nSo, in short, if you're in the area of this or any of the other Lenny's, give'em a shot - you're sure to be in for a treat.

Without question, she was interested in doing what's best for the cat, and not the clinic's finances.\n\nBased on the cat's age, intolerance for stress (yes, he pooped once in my car, twice in their office), and other health conditions, she advised neither radiation therapy (5 days per week!) nor radical surgery were the best options, especially given the cost vs the likelihood that the tumors would return anyway.  Instead, she suggested use of a topical cream marketed for the two-legged population, which can be applied at home and will hopefully result in making Big Sexy more comfortable.

I would definitely recommend southwest to all my friends!\n\nI went to Deer Creek Animal Hospital (DCAH) to get diagnosis and treatment for my 1 year old pitbull who fractured his leg and I walked away with:\n- Confusion through miscommunication\n- Double the costs than I should have (steer clear of any \"specialist\" options they may throw your way)\n- Mistrust for the veterinary community\n- Emotional stress\n- A dog who had to go through more distress than necessary\n- The staff pointing the finger at me for wanting speedy treatment on my dogs fractured leg (who knew you had to be an expert to receive proper care and treatment from a vet. I thought they were the ones who were supposed to advocate for their customers, both human and four legged)\n\nThe only positive that I walked away with from DCAH was a referral to Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service. Here they were able to properly diagnose and treatment my dog. No confusion, no miscommunications, just educated professionals that know that a 1 year old pitbull who has a mildly displaced fracture should have a wrap, not full blown surgery, as conducting surgery and placing pins in 1 year olds joint would cause MORE damage than a basic wrap/cast.\n \nIf you ever have an injured animal, skip DCAH and go directly to a board certified doctor who can give you proper diagnosis and treatment. Not only will you get better diagnosis and treatment, but you will save yourself and your animal a huge headache/emotional distress and you will also save some money too.", "business_id": "3NKwuV-QLXYYceEPpNa9ng", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-06-15", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Amanda", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "KzflYSGvG61zB4k3o2Jjlg", "review_id": "SgBhhCN4mkdKek0MVsnC6Q", "text": "So far so good.

Light, flavorful and not rubbery at all.\n\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The salad was average. A nice touch we got was sorbet at the end of the meal.\n\nThe decor was nice, the service was awesome.

Another couple joined us, and it was a first time for them, too.  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is a beautiful, old world design, complete with pillars; it made me feel as if we were in Italy.  I was sorry to see that it was nearly empty at prime dinner hour, but then saw it quickly populated by two different Japanese tour groups; the first headed to a back room and the second group sat in the main dining room.  (Aside:  They were NOT given menus, which is why I never travel on tours!).\n\nOur waiter, Wes, was excellent.  Oh, he was a bit too pushy on the upsell, but then again, our friends were served the lower-priced chardonnay when they ordered without realizing there were two differently-priced ones to choose from.  Wes obviously has been at the restaurant for quite a while; his presentation of the specials was polished, and his service was wonderful without being intrusive.\n\nAll four of us ordered chicken dishes, all different.  I had the Marchegiana, which had roasted red peppers and mozzarella in a light orange-colored wine sauce.  My husband had Marsala, and it was covered with an abundance of dark, earthy mushrooms.  The other hubby, Mr. Unadventurous, stuck with his usual Chicken Parmegiana.  He has special blinders that let him see only that dish on the menu, and this time he had no complaints.  His wife ordered a lemon chicken dish; she liked it, but pronounced it a little too lemony.  Um, maybe that's why they call it Lemon Chicken?\n\nA good, crusty bread, made in-house, was served with a delicious pesto butter.  I would have preferred it in the usual baguette style, instead of the thin loaf-like slices, but it tasted great anyway.\n\nThe grand piano was put to good use by a player who's been around since before the Mob.  Happily, it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation, so it definitely enhanced the experience.\n\nMy major complaint is that, like so many other restaurants, the prices on their website are not updated, so it was an unwelcome surprise to see them all $3-4 higher than posted online, though still moderate by Vegas standards.  But with the discount, it was still reasonable for a wonderful meal with great service in a classy setting.", "business_id": "s5yzZITWU_RcJzWOgjFecw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-01", "type": "review"}, {"username": "R", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "WAFqKc8IvVENBKThDYaCxA", "review_id": "aejos_Mw4iSoMTsCOgcrsQ", "text": "So 15 years ago, after reading a zagat review, we went to Sergio's for dinner and had a wonderful experience.

I of course, read the Yelp reviews, and was happy to see that our wonderful  experience had not been a fluke as there are dozens of raving reviews.\nWe came in for lunch and right away were greeted by Francisco. He told us he had worked there since the restaurant opened in 1993. We confided that we had  last been there in 1997 and had had a wonderful meal. Francisco made sure that same experience was duplicated. He recommended the Caesars salad which we found to be delicious, fresh snapping romaine, shaved parmesan, and the dressing was delicious.\nI ordered the Pollo alla Parmigiana. This was a chichen breast sautted in a Pinot Grigio wine sauce with mushrooms, caper and lemon. The sauce was outstanding. It was simply delicious.\nMy wife ordered the Linguine with clams and clam sauce. We have found it very difficult to find a restaurant who prepares this dish well. Aside from Carmine's in Pasadena.

Five friends and I had dinner there a few days ago and we ALL loved it.  \n\nFOOD:  I had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari) in a special sauce over linguini.  This is probably the best pasta dish I've had in a long time.  It was not only incredibly flavorful but the seafood was fresh, just enough sauce and a very large portion.  Pricey at $38 but well worth the price.  The others in my group had Eggplant with Chicken, Veal Picatta, and a beef dish but can't remember what it was.  Everyone was especially pleased.  \nThe salad came with what the owner/waiter described as one of the best creamy Italian dressings in town.  He was absolutely right.  Don't miss the fresh, and perfectly dressed salad with a dressing to die for!!\n\nSERVICE:  Okay here's where it goes downhill.  We like having a leisurely drink before ordering but we had to wait, not only to order when we were ready, but for our dinners to be served because there was a party of 15 in the back room that obviously got top priority.  Not a big deal for us but we did wait a very long time.  \n\nAMBIENCE:  Not  a particularly warm and cozy place but nicely decorated . Our party had to put their jackets back on because it really was cool in there and the waiter said the a/c was not on.

The website says that they'll make sure it's an event to remember... and boy were they right!  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  And I will ALWAYS remember that they ruined my wedding day!  I must give them credit on the food though... the food was great.  That was the only positive thing about it.  \n\nWe should have known from the start that we wouldn't be taken care of.  I filled out the online banquet form a couple of months ago and a few days later when we hadn't heard anything back, we decided to call.  We had to call over the span of a few days because either no one would answer the phone or the person answering would just simply tell us that the person that handles that is not here.  Finally we got in touch with someone and let them know our menu choices and paid the $500 deposit ($250 of which went towards the private room we requested).  Three days before the wedding we called back to confirm the number of guests that would be attending and to ensure that everything was good to go.  We were told that everything was good to go and that everything would be taken care of.\n\nWe arrived at Sergio's (the restaurant was very empty on a Saturday night so we were already a little reserved about how it was going to be) and they immediately tried to sit us at a table in the dining room with other guests even though we had paid $250 for a private room.  We told them that since the restaurant was so empty that we didn't mind sitting there, to just reimburse us the $250 private room fee.  The waiter told us that since we signed a contract that we had to abide by it and sat us in the private dining room... no big deal.  Once in the private room the waiter immediately began handing out menus, which confused us because we chose a pre-selected, family style banquet menu... well I guess the manager FORGOT to mention to the staff that there would be a wedding coming in and they didn't prepare our menu!!!!  I guess it's a good thing I decided against getting my cake through the restaurant and ordered one through our chapel because they would have FORGOTTEN to make our wedding cake!  So the guest has to abide by the contract, but the restaurant doesn't.... awesome!  We were all hungry so we decided to just have everyone order off of the menu.  The food came and the food was delicious.  We have no complaints about that piece.\n\nSergio's also advertises a complimentary shuttle service to and from hotels on the strip... when the time came for us to finally leave that awful dining experience we asked for the shuttle to take us back to our hotel.  We were told that they did not have a shuttle and that they would call us cabs instead.  Whenever it was mentioned to them that they advertised a shuttle on their website and that they needed to honor that all of a sudden they went outside and started the van that they use to shuttle guests!!!\n\nWorst.wedding.reception.EVER!\n\nAnd to make matters worse, we never heard from the manager afterwards apologizing for their gagglef*ck of a restaurant.\n\nI WOULD recommend this restaurant to eat in for a nice night out... but don't book your wedding reception there... they will ruin what is supposed to be the happiest day of your life.", "business_id": "s5yzZITWU_RcJzWOgjFecw", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-04-01", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Lisa", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "XTMY8u0l1fMCSiSszAwPYA", "review_id": "cxuXHDCsgkv8AfFL1EFuBw", "text": "We stumbled upon Sergio's by accident back in 2009 and now it is a MUST VISIT every time we go back to Vegas.

Here goes:\n\nFirst I want to say we were a party of 7 and there was a 2 top that was there and a 8 top that already had their food. \n\nFood: Last time I checked there weren't potatoes in Minestrone soup. However my vegetable soup (Minestrone) had decent flavor, not very many vegetables. My husband had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari)... he ate it all no complaint. My cousin had some Angel Hair Pasta dish, one bite pushed it aside and wouldn't take another bite. What kind of waiter doesn't inquire what is the matter? (she was worried about sending food back) My friend said the meatballs had good flavor. Another said the Veal Parmesan was really salty. \nService: There was a guy, I think he was the Busser, he had a pony-tail. He was very helpful and ran his tail off. We waited a really long time for our food. It did warn us on our menu that the food takes awhile  because it's made to order... I get that, but it was longer than I have EVER waited. Our Waiter was not very helpful and only saw him 2 times... he took our order and brought our check. (I will get to that later)\n\nBeverages: House Cabernet at 9.00 a glass... I probably could have bout the case at Costco for that price.  Not the most generous pour, then again why would I want more of it. My husband and another gentleman had 6 beers (total)  54.00 before tax and tip. There are no prices on their beer selection. \n\nNow this is where the real issue comes in... \n\nThey do not have a computer, so the writing on the check is really messy. If we didn't try to separate our check ourselves we wouldn't have noticed that they charged us for 8 meals instead of 7. He took the check and counted the meals on the check and then pointed his finger as if a teacher in pre-school counting the 7 of us. I think I can count, he served us, he should know how many of us there was. I am hoping it was an accident. My issue is that he only brought out 7 plates... he didn't even bring us 8. So I am questioning his honesty. Then he deducted the 24.00 for the mistake from the total. I had to ask him to deduct the tip and tax for the meal also. \n\nBottom line, if one of the guys that he gave the check to just slapped down his credit card without looking the waiter could have pocketed another 26.50, besides that 51.00 he got for the tip that was added in. \n\nService was terrible,  Most of the food not worth they money. Atmosphere was super quite and dreary.

She simply doesn't like it. \n\nMy wife ordered a side of angel hair pasta. We never received it - and couldn't get it in a timely fashion. Why? Because our waiter apparently went home for the night after taking our order. Never told us. Just left. And no one else came to check on us or even bus our table. We had to call another waiter over who reluctantly grabbed her side  dish, after she was finished with her main course for quite some time. \n\nWe requested to speak with the manager at the end. \"Sorry about that.

I got the Veal Piccatta, which was actually very good. My fiance got the chicken parmigiana and a side of pasta, of which both were swimming in sauce.

We had stopped at casa di amore which is down the street but that's another story in itself. As we arrived there was waiting staff smoking a cigarette outside. As we walked in there was a piano player playing live music. The d\u00e9cor is pretty tacky with the blue sky and clouds trying to make it feel like your in venice. We weren't greeted by a hostess and really weren't greeted at all. The waiter simply grabbed two menus and waived us over. We sat down, we could hear a loud party in the back. It took about 8 mins until our waiter showed up. When he did; he did not go over the specials all he said was are you ready and looked at us. So we ordered chicken marsala and cheese raviolis. Tryna play it safe as the service has been horrible up to this point. You get offered a soup and salad. Bread was served, the pesto butter was very nice along with the hot bread. Nothing really bad to say about the food. Ive had a lot better and worse. The veggies along with the marsala were soaked in butter. Other than that marsala was spot on. As we finished up another waiter asked if we were done because we had been sitting there for so long. He brought 2 boxes over to put our food in and looked at us with his hand out as we boxed our own food. Now if we could only get that check. That literally took about 25 minutes as we sat there; now keep in mind I can see our waiter at the front talking to another waiter. Oh wait, cherry on top, as my lady had to get up and ask for the check; it ended up being hand written. Good thing I pay cash cause I could immediately get up and leave. As for the couple across from me they were very patient waiting up to 35 minutes with credit card in hand. Not sure how they ring up a credit card when they have no hostess no register no pos system. Maybe they take their phones from their pocket and swipe it. Nonetheless Ill never go back here and it had nothing to do with the food. The service was absolutely horrid. They should be ashamed to open up. If there were no stars that's what id rate them. The food is about 2.5 stars.

And I had to ask if it was even hamburger! I thought maybe some kind of sirloin or something, but no, it was hamburger and it was good!  We definitely had leftovers and they were happy to box them up for us and even wrapped up some more bread and fabulous Pesto butter!!

In that time I have always received excellent service and excellent quality in the food. Last night, however, things were very different. Yesterday was my step daughter's 15th birthday. My husband, his ex-wife and myself always take her out to eat a special dinner on her birthday. This year she wanted to try something different and go to Sergios. We had a reservation for 5pm and when we were seated, the staff started to struggle almost immediately. We were greeted by Francisco who took our drink orders and read us the specials. As soon as Francisco left, another staff member came to ask us for our drinks, we told him we had already been asked for our beverage orders by someone else. That staff member left, and a third staff member, Herb came and asked for our drink orders again. Then we tried to browse the menu. Our two teenage daughters have never been to an Italian place that had so many non-English words on the menu before, so I was taking my time explaining everything they were asking about. The staff seemed to dislike this, as Herb, Francisco and the third staff member all came by multiple times to inform us over and over again of the specials and to try and up-sell our choices. When we did eventually order, A woman arrived with a small child who immediately began to throw a tantrum. The child was screaming and running around the dining room, at one time even climbing in and under the curtains on the window, while the mother did nothing but play on her phone and the staff did nothing about this. The child continued to run and scream for the duration of our meal while the staff continued to pretend it wasn't happening. \n\nAt one point, my husband's ex-wife asked if she could have a straw for her water, Herb jokingly reach into our daughters Shirley Temple, removed her straw and offered it to her mother \"Here's a straw you can have right here\". This was both rude and unsanitary. \n\nIt took a very long time for our food to come out and when it did, it did not come out all together. The waiter, Herb, came out from the kitchen and asked us our orders all over again, and then said it would be a few more minutes. Shortly thereafter, he brought out three of our meals and said the rest would be out momentarily. We did the polite thing which is to not eat and to wait until everyone at the table has been served. It was over 20 minutes before the other two people at our table were served. In that time the food on the table had gotten cold. Ordinarily, this is the precise moment when I would ask to speak to a manager, but these were special circumstances. Our daughter was having her birthday dinner and we didn't want any confrontation to become a permanent memory on her special day. So we continued with our meal. When it came time to get the check, we were brought a check for just under $100. My husband's ex-wife had a discount coupon that was good for $15 off of our meal. We gave Herb the coupon and $100 bill to cover the check. Herb takes our check and the money and disappears, reappearing moments later with a new check for over $140 dollars, saying to my husband \"I bet you didn't even notice that wasn't the right check before, this is the right check and I will take the discount off of this\". We were outraged by this, of course, but again, it was our daughter's birthday and she was more important than our desire to make a scene. It seems wrong to me, to give us one check, and then when we present a coupon, bring us another check for almost 50% more than the first check, Even if it was a genuine mistake on their part, it could have been communicated without condescending to my husband in front of his daughter on her birthday.\n\nI am very disappointed in the service we received. Half way through our time there it really felt like the staff just sort of gave up. I literally live right across the street from the restaurant, I can see their sign from my balcony, and yet I just cannot see us ever going back there after what happened last night.", "business_id": "s5yzZITWU_RcJzWOgjFecw", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-12-27", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Leona", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "gN5bCXtynAZsT2MYQsHKPg", "review_id": "rgPdG-AdHcwzjlQnHFcKoQ", "text": "Herb is a wonderful and pleasant waiter.

Sergio's is one of these gems!!\n\nWe went on a Sunday night. We were seated right away. The service was a bit old Vegas, but very prompt. Everything is cooked to order, so it is a bit slower than a lot of places. \n\nThey have a piano player!! He was really great and he plays a lot of contemporary songs...so we had fun naming that tune. One of the best parts of our visit!!\n\nThey have a decent sized wine list. I had a glass of Malbec. You can choose soup or salad with your meal. The warm bread and pesto butter were fantastic.\n\nWe both ordered 2 pretty basic pasta dishes - a Rigatoni with a meat sauce and a Penne with tomatoes, garlic, basil, & mozzarella. Both came out piping hot and delicious. Honestly, I was surprised at how fresh everything tasted.\n\nFor dessert we shared a flan. Normally, this is a favorite of mine, but the sauce was more orange liqueur than caramel which I didn't know ahead of time so I didn't love it the way I normally do.\n\nThe bill was $61 plus tip for 2 people.\n\nI would definitely return to try some other dishes!!", "business_id": "s5yzZITWU_RcJzWOgjFecw", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-01-18", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Denise", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "kird7kY1Lm-n8qDtoCV9zA", "review_id": "Hp9RGUWrfmiFT6jX6uUJyw", "text": "Looking for the gem of Las Vegas?

Unfortunately, not the point in which I was completely astonished. Without further ado, here are the simple reasons why I am only satisfactory with what I ate.\n\nPros:\nAll of the food that each of us ate was delicious. I ordered the Friday Fish Fry, my sister ordered the Strawberry Walnut Salad, and my father ordered the California Burger. The Friday Fish Fry was decently large. It included a fried fish with tartar sauce, a mini salad with mayonnaise, lots of French fries with ketchup, and two pieces of flatbread. The fish was extraordinarily crunchy and fresh. When I look to the other dishes, I saw that they are enjoying them as well. The Strawberry Walnut Salad is full of fresh greens, but not many strawberries. The service was extraordinary. They always seem to check on you every five to ten minutes, and if you happen to dislike a specific channel on TV, you can tell them and they will immediately change the channel.\n\nCons:\nThe location is tiny. During a football, basketball, soccer, etc. game, the place is CROWDED, and you may have to wait about 10-30 minutes until you get seated. (Wait until the Super Bowl XLIX starts. It will be absolutely miserable waiting for a SINGLE seat.) The food takes pretty long to prepare on these crowded days(then again, the forty-ninth Super Bowl) so you will have to be patient.\n\nOne thing is for sure, I'm coming back (early) for the Super Bowl.

I brought in my truck (I hand wash/2 bucket method my other vehicles) and was immediately thrown off (not knowing ownership had changed) when new costs were added to the price.  $10 for mud removal (okay the truck was muddy) but then another $3 for excessive dirt...umm you're a car wash?  The truck was muddy as I took it off-road, but it's not the first time and the previous owners always took care of it without any up-charges.  If the car came out just as clean as it used to I probably wouldn't be writing any update to this (previously 4 star review), but instead I found the roof to be dirty and the driver side had numerous swirl marks and a few minor scratches (and no this didn't happen off-roading - there was no mud in this area and I inspect the truck daily...I noticed this as soon as I got home and parked it after the wash).  There are many water marks, the tire spray and interior dressing all appear to have worn off in less than 24 hours and there is over-spray on the fenders.  It does not appear that quality cleaning products are used and either they are not using the correct non-abrasive cleaning cloths or used at least one after it fell on the ground.  Sadly I will now have to go back to N. Scottsdale 20 minutes away to get a quality hand-wash.\n\nPrior Owner 4 star Review: Ever since Big J closed up his physical location and went mobile I have been struggling to find a proper car wash facility.  As someone who only hand washes my vehicles it is difficult to find a good hand car wash at a reasonable price.  There are some really great detail shops in N. Scottsdale, but most operate by appointment only (which is why I generally don't use mobile services) and can be a little pricier.  Stewart Detailing is the first true hand wash and dry I have found that is in my area, reasonably priced and seems to perform a very good wash.  The only thing I have noticed is the bug cleaning on the front is not a thorough as it should be and I tend to finish the job when I get home.  I have used them four times now with my vehicle and each wash was as good as the last.  They also have a dog wash on premise which I have not utilized yet, but is a pretty good idea and allows customers to do something productive while they wait.  They have a shaded sitting area and two indoor sitting areas, one where customers can view their vehicle being washed which is conducted indoors and another where customers have a view of their vehicle being dried and detailed.  I like being able to keep an eye on my car.\n\nThe staff has been very friendly and took no issue with my occasional request to clean a specific area more thoroughly such as my carpeted truck bed.

They are a CSA that pull from a collective of small farms in central CA (I think around the Fresno area), who stock 100% USDA organic fruits and vegetables, at very reasonable prices!  You can grab from an assortment of individual items by the pound from the storefront on Eastern and Pebble, choosing your own fruits, veggies, and herbs, and/or you can go the route of the traditional CSA box of surprise goodies.  The prices are insanely reasonable - my husband and I split a $22 small box each week and it pretty much fulfills our fruit and veggie needs for that week.  My guess is they dole out about 10 - 15 lbs of healthy goodness for that price.\n\nUnlike the traditional CSA where you buy a share for a whole season, they let you purchase boxes one week ahead of time, so you don't have to deal with the hassle of finding someone to take your share for the week if you're heading out of town, and you can modify what you get as you go based on how much you discover that you eat.  You can get boxes with all veggies, all fruit, or a mix of both.  They are also ridiculously accommodating, letting you sub out items if there are things you adore or dislike, and they also fill your box based on your particular diet.  Trish and Ed are very friendly, and the service has been impeccable, which makes it even more of a great deal!

We have shopped the farmers market stand for the entire summer and decided to give the weekly service a try. It is $30 a week, with a starter fee for the cute boxes that have your name engraved on them. I was happy to give a newer small business owner a chance, but often I got the impression that they are doing me the favor and each week I was throwing away a quarter to half the box from rot or wilting produce. I had traded the Bet on the Farm market for their box and it was just okay and highly unpredictable on produce received. At pick up, I found Tim to be friendly, he is good guy with who is well meaning.  In the weekly boxes I have received amazing produce, and then I have received apples that were rotten black, a pomi that was fuzzy moldy inside and black, kiwis that were shriveled, soft bendy carrots, wilted heads of lettuce and spinach, moldy grapes, and the list goes on.  Tim always did his best to make up for the bad produce at the market, but the box always contained some gross produce. A disadvantage over picking it out on your own at the market. They require that you fill out a form that says all the items you want and then make no promises to provide one of those ten requested items. Interesting concept and not exactly consumer friendly.  At the store, Trish is an entitled and confrontational owner that did not impress me at all. We got into it a bit and she made some very snarky comments and behaved like she was doing me a favor for selling me produce that is often delivered moldy or wilted or ready to rot. I'm not going to deny that it super pissed me off and it took everything I had not explode at her for her aggressive posture, language, and snarky comments. Trish had told Tim that she wanted to \"fire\" me as a customer and I told Tim that was fine. That evening I got a message from Trish to call her. No reason for the call just to call her back. Did she really expect me to call her after our last friendly experience? Hah! Hilarious. She didn't even have the courage to leave an honest message saying that she wasn't going to deliver to the west side for my pick up anymore. OK by me. I was already waiting a few months before I was going to review them (one or two deliveries does not make for fair eval) and low and behold they drove their own review destiny with average to extremely poor service and unpredictable product.

I support small businesses especially like this with it being organic. I know Trish has been busting her butt since they have opened and from what she told me is she has worked extremely hard to please as many people as possible. My experience has been positive.  I have been in there when women are in there and they are so demanding and disrespectful to the staff I think to myself, how do they do it.

I will be honest, I don't always get perfect stuff but I understand how organic works. If there is a problem, I talk with Trish and she is more than happy to explain and replace. I will be with them as long as they are here in Vegas. I am excited for their pluots and stone fruit! I was told today it will be here next week!!! I love the juice bar too! Only ALL organic juice bar in Vegas that gets 90% of their stuff direct from the farm! Some things like banana's and pineapple is hard to get in the states!

I am reposting it sans any personal information or other questionable content.**\n\nI called Heart Savers to schedule a BLS for healthcare providers course and spoke to a polite female on the phone. She confirmed there was space available on the date I requested to attend the course, and took my information. \n\nFast forward a couple of days...As luck would have it, there was a terrible accident on the 202 on my way to the class. Ten minutes before class was scheduled to start I phoned Heart Savers to inform them that I would be a few minutes late, but there was no answer. I called sever time over the next 10 minutes to no avail. \n\nI pulled into a parking spot in front of Heart Savers at 6:09 PM. I entered the location, and there was a woman sitting at one of the desks in the front room. She looked down her nose at me without so much as a greeting. I informed her that I was there for the CPR class. She said that the video had just started and that I could not enter the classroom. I explained that there was a serious accident (as it turns out it was a deadly roll-over) on the highway that had caused the delay. Stared at me as if I was speaking a different language. I then read the telephone number I had been calling aloud to verify that I had been dialing the right number. She confirmed the number was correct, but said she didn't answer the phone because she was teaching the class. The problem with this was that I had called several times between 5:50 and 6:00 PM, before class was scheduled to begin. She maintained that she was teaching and could not answer the phones. I went on to explain that I had a job interview the following day and that I needed to have my new CPR card in order to be considered for the position. She shrugged her shoulders and stared. Frustrated with the situation I headed to the door and muttering under my breath. I asked the woman for her name and exited the building in shambles. \n\nOnce outside, I called the location again. Despite the fact that she was sitting in the front room where the phone was ringing, she did not answer. She just looked at the phone and then continued to do whatever it was that she was doing. I was furious! I sat in my car fuming trying to figure out what to do.  I decided that I needed to get the heck out of there, and make sure the world knows that Heart Savers treats paying customers like imbeciles? Yes! That was the perfect solution. \n\nSo here I sit, writing to say that if you value small things, like good customer service, and being treated with respect, you may want to take your business elsewhere. If this instructor is any indication of what the rest of the Heart Savers staff is like you can expect to be treated as if you are a lesser life form.\n\nI understand that rules are rules. If the policy is that no one may enter the class once the video starts, so be it. But is it really that that hard to greet a customer when they enter your establishment? And, God forbid, treating that customer with a little respect, compassion and understanding. A simple, \"I am sorry but...\" would have gone a long, long way in this situation.\n\nI assure you that Heart Savers will never receive a cent from me.

We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.

Ever since then, my wife and I have been motivated to refresh our CPR skills. Also, working in a healthcare profession, it's good for me to be certified anyway.\n\nA brief online search brought me to Heart Savers. They offer a great combo package of CPR, AED (automated external defibrillator), and First Aid certifications. Be sure to choose the one credentialed by the American Safety Health Institute. The locations were better than the ones offered by the Red Cross, and $50 for about 6 hours of hands-on instruction is a great deal. I paid online, but you can also pay in-person.\n\nOur class began at 8 am on Sunday morning. We got signed in with our instructor Scott and waited for class to begin. During the introduction, several students came in late. One was even 40 minutes late and still accepted. It sounds like Heart Savers has improved their customer service from several years back ;)\n\nThe instruction was great! Scott gave us a great overview of CPR procedures, explaining how to assess the victim and the steps to take depending on the severity of the situation. We then got to perform our skills on both baby and adult-sized manikins. Scott did a nice job of tying in fun movie references and kept the training lighthearted. I can't say I was ever really bored the whole time and learned a ton. \n\nAfter the CPR/AED course, we had about a 20 minute break before the First Aid session, so we ran to a nearby Circle K for snacks.

He made it palatable and seemed to have his heart in the right place, so to speak.  The organization with which I was attempting to gain employment also had a relationship with Heart Savers, and thus also a discount.  So the cost, overall, was competitive.\n\nNow, all that alone would have merited 4 stars.  Where they really earned their fifth star was in customer service.

I contacted the office and worked with a staff member (I want to say...Gennifer?) via e-mail to adjust the days. No problem!

Distraught and frustrated, I figured out the mistake I'd made and again reached out to Gennifer, for a second (and final) adjustment to my enrollment.

The instructor I had did an outstanding job, I could tell he was very experienced and cared about what he did. BUT...\n\nAt the beginning of the class I noticed out of the 10 infant mannequins only one was black. Although I found it to be a little bit weird that there was this one random black mannequin out of 10, it really didn't bother me. However, I was curious to know why they chose to have one black mannequin versus having a more diverse and balanced ethnic distribution or just having all white mannequins. But at the end of the day however a company chooses to run their  business is completely their right. So when it was time to begin our demonstration, me being the only black person in the class I decided to eliminate all awkwardness and select the black infant for myself. As you can see all the babies are dressed up in their cute little onesies but it wasn't until I got up close to my baby and noticed that it was dressed in a monkey onesie. Now I am the last person that anyone could accuse of race baiting but this immediately rubbed me the wrong way. But before I overreacted I checked all the other babies clothing to check and see if they could possibly be dressed in a monkey onesie as well. Unfortunately, that was not the case. All of the other babies were dressed in giraffe, bird, dolphin, sports, Princess onesies, etc. All but monkey onesies. Out of 10 mannequin babies the lone black baby ended up in the monkey onesie. So that means before dressing the babies there was a 10% chance that the black baby would end up in the monkey onesie but there was a 90% chance that the black baby would not. But it just so happens that it fell in the 10%? Is this a coincidence or did the person dressing the babies intentionally placed the baby in the monkey onesie?\n\nLet's just say this was done out of sheer ignorance. Does that make it ok? \n\nNow for those whites and ignorant people that don't see what the big deal is...\n\nMonkey is an extremely derogatory term used to describe black people by whites for hundreds of years and is still present to this very day. Not only were we called monkeys, the Constitution states that we are only 3/5 of a human being to begin with so seeing this in 2016 really made my stomach turn. I'm sure many out there will want these type of issues to just be swept under a rug and not be correctly addressed but this is a huge reason why society is filled with hate today because of the underlying and covert racisms that continue to remain prominent in this country.

The first thing to comment on is the view-- it really is gorgeous and adds to the allure and fun of dining at a place like this. If you and your significant other are both into steaks, I think this place is a great choice just on that basis alone. It offers a refreshing atmosphere that really seems to take you away from the mundane activities of daily life. But I digress..\n\nService is good here. The hostess didn't glare when she saw our groupon and I appreciate this seemingly small fact. The waiter had a fair understanding of the menu and offered a number of suggestions based on our preferences and experiences with previous steak houses. Cheaping out, we neglected to order an appetizer and went straight for the main course.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a veal with pasta dish. I don't recall the name, but it was respectably good. The pasta was light and had the distinct flavor of sauteed shallots throughout it, and I am certain it was cooked with a certain amount of wine. The veal was incredibly tender--probably the softest I have ever had at a restaurant. What sets this place apart is the quality of the meat; the waiter was sure to point out how very particular this establishment is about the meat here and where they get it from.\n\nI decided to order something from their prime section, which includes a delicious looking wagyu cut that I will have to try next time. I instead opted for a 14 oz flat iron. I rarely order flat irons simply because most restaurants don't even offer them. Only a high quality cut is worthy of being served at the fine dining level. \n\nAfter much thought and internal conflict, I chose the Truffle Mac n' Cheese as my side.\nIt was incredibly rich, and full of flavor. Not like the stuff you can get at Lucille's barbecue, as this offering had a much more distinct taste. However, it was every bit as good, if not just a bit different. You can really appreciate the different cheeses in it with each bite, but like I said it's really heavy. I wanted to finish my steak so I decided only to eat half of it and saved the rest for an enjoyable leftovers session.\n\nThe steak itself was impressive. I was not expecting to enjoy a cut like flat iron because it is categorized below rib eye and new york in terms of quality. However, because it was prime beef I really was able to enjoy its flavor and thick consistency. It doesn't have some of the same marbling that you'll get in a filet mignon but in a way it is more enjoyable and it was prepared perfectly here. I gobbled it up without difficulty. \n\nI can't say I'll be returning here soon because I just don't have that sort of money, but suffice it to say that I'll bookmark this place as a good spot for a celebration if I am still in Vegas years down the line.", "business_id": "gq7u9uyOkpLCeh_lxR-WFw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-11-19", "type": "review"}, {"username": "David", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "hcnHQ3NSgtASSAJHrD4ZxQ", "review_id": "L2iWpal61NGECphddDsE5w", "text": "I had been to the VooDoo Nightclub before, so I knew the view at VooDoo Steak would be wonderful.

My husband and I are young and not big drinkers, so we're no strangers to having restaurants assume we won't tip well, but the staff at Voodoo really took that to a new height.\n\nTo start off, we had a 6:00 reservation and weren't seated until almost 6:30.  Wouldn't have been a big deal, except that three or four couples who arrived after we'd already been waiting for almost twenty minutes were all seated before we were.  Not sure what's up with that when they tell you that they can't hold your reservation for more than ten minutes.\n\nThen our server, Christian, came over to introduce himself, and from the first words out of his mouth, he was brusque almost to the point of rudeness and, frankly, just seemed pissed off to be waiting on us.  I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, since it's the night before Thanksgiving--maybe he was bummed to be at work the night before a holiday--but I could hear him interacting with the tables around us, and he was friendly and talkative to them.  He sounded irritated every time he spoke to us, was flat-out rude when he came to bring us our check and get us a to-go box for the food we couldn't finish, and remained just as rude and impatient when we paid the check and gave him a good tip.\n\nI loved their food, but being treated like I'm an inconvenience because someone assumes that being young and sober = being a shitty tipper kind of ruins the dining experience for me, especially when I'm eating at a fancy restaurant.

But when the switch was made, the Shrimp Cocktail was excellent, with large shrimps resting on a bed of lettuce.  A Caesar Salad was peppery but good.

After looking through their website, we selected the Voodoo steakhouse and made reservations.\n\nAmbiance\nMixed bag here.  The restaurant is reasonably nice and the view from the 52nd floor is outstanding.   The only real negative I have is that the restaurant's website clearly states that they have a dress code but the restaurant seems to make no effort to enforce it.  Seated next to us was a group with backwards baseball caps on and next to them were 4 guys in shorts and t-shirts.  I realize that I am old and so stuff like this probably matters more to me than to most people but my feeling is that if you are going to advertise a dress code then people will use that information to help make their decision whether or not to go there.  If you have no intention of enforcing it, then that seems like false advertising to me.\n\nFood\nWe started with crab cakes that were dry and burnt to the point that The Empress did not want them.  We then moved to bisque for me and a salad for her, both of which were average.  The main course was lobster thermidor for me and sea bass for Milady.  She said hers was just okay but I was really disappointed in mine.  There was no thermidor sauce that I could find and it was really bland.  Dessert was also pretty average.  Definitely not the quality of food you would associate with the kind of place they are trying to be.\n\nService\nBad.  We perpetually could not get drink refills because our waiter would disappear for long stretches.  Even then, simple things like offering The Empress some pepper to take away some of the blandness of her salad were overlooked even though he did it for the table right next to ours.\n\nOverall\nAs you can see from this review, we were pretty unimpressed with the place.  One thing I will add is that I thought it was very low value.  We each had only one drink (because we could not get anyone to get us another one) and still ended up spending almost $200.

I ordered the 10oz fillet mignon with demiglaze and asked for 'extra sauce on the side', medium-rare with the truffled macc and cheese, and broccoli with garlic and oil for my two sides.  Meal came out without any sauce on the side and barely any on the meat.  I asked for my side of sauce and they brought out an amount that still wasnt enough for the whole steak.....I gave up on the sauce. Meat was dry and overcooked which is a huge negative for a steakhouse.  The macc and cheese could have been from any mediocre buffet and the broccoli was practically raw.....way too crunchy and tough.    Now it's 2 hours after eating and I don't feel 100%.....a little stomach uneasiness.

Restaurant Week gave me the impetus to go for dinner and to check out the new zip line attraction from the patio.\n\nYou have to check in on the second floor of the Rio's Masquerade Tower and then ride the glass elevator up the side of the building to the next to top floor.  The restaurant was almost empty at 5:30 when I arrived.  \n\nI was seated quickly at a window table facing the Bellagio and other south Strip properties across the freeway.  I was soon brought menus--I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered an iced tea which was soon at the table and I got a nice basket of bread.\n\nFor the first course, I got the classic French onion soup.  It was a good rendition of this soup that I haven't gotten in quite some time.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the flat iron steak extra rare.  It was a little too cooked for me but not enough to make me grimace.  The cut by nature is not the most tender steak cut but it has a lot of good flavor.  The red wine reduction added to the good beef flavor.\n\nFor dessert, I chose the assorted ice creams.  In this case, there were three dips of ice cream, pistachio, coffee, and vanilla with some fresh berries.\n\nService was very good.  My empty artificial sweetener packets were removed from the table as soon as a server or busser walked by.  Iced tea was refilled before my glass was empty, and plates were cleared in a timely manner.\n\nAfter I ordered, my server told me to enjoy the patio and that I should feel free to take my iced tea outside with me.  This gave me a chance to take some photos and to check out that new zip line.  When I went back in, the server said he'd start my order.  This happened on my first visit years ago, and it's a nice touch especially for tourists who want to get photos of themselves with the resort corridor hotels behind them.\n\nThis was a good meal but it's not a place I'd regularly visit.

We know a bit about beef in Alberta. My butcher in Calgary hangs meat for 14 days then wet ages it for a further 14. I then buy an entire Canadian Prime strip loin and they hang it for an additional 14 days for me. This is perhaps the best beef on earth. We do not have corn fed beef, we have grass fed, barley finished beef that is amazing in quality. The fat is white and these steaks are marbled almost to a Wagyu standard.  \n\nI know how to cook a steak. I lightly season the beef and then sous vide cook it for at least 2 hours at 130 F. I then sit the beef for 20 minutes and finish it a cast iron pan that is nearly glowing with heat. These are fork tender steaks of the most astonishing flavour. \n\nI have eaten beef all over the world and honestly think this is the best. That said, I acknowledge that U.S.D.A. Prime is also awesome beef.\n\nThe steaks at Voodoo don't come close to this quality.\n\nWhile the room is nice, the view great, and the ambience very good, the kitchen and service are nowhere near where they should be for this level of expense.\n\nAnd expensive its is. Four of us racked up a 600 buck tab with a fairly good wine selection. We did not order the standard issue 'American' giant slabs of meat, just nice 8 or 10 oz fillets.

The Bisque however was truly great. \n\nOf the four steaks two were very over cooked, one was very undercooked and one was missing a topping.

It had a crispy breading around it and inside was wonderful shredded crab meat. Delish! I will say that we brought two bottles of wine from our wine collection at home and the corkage fee was an extremely reasonable $25. \nFor the entree, we all ordered the Land and Sea M\u00e9nage a trois.  Filet mignon, lobster tail and grilled shrimp. Amazing. We all cleaned our plates and also had a side of creamed spinach that made the \"non creamed spinach eater\" eat his words. \nWe ended our meal with the chocolate cake and carrot cake.

The server made a point to (rudely) make we aware I was ordering RED zinfandel.  I'm 42 and was dressed appropriately for a nice dinner, so am not sure why he felt the need to let me know my $20 glass of wine was red -- not pink.   The fact that he thought that I he apparently thought I looked like I should be ordering pink zinfandel was insulting.  \n\nMy husband asked if they served any mocktails and the waiter gave us a completely blank look, even after we explained what those were.  At the restaurant we went to the prior night, the waiter had an entire list of mocktails available.  \n\nWhen I ordered a 2nd glass of wine, I asked for the house cabernet.  The server corrected me -- saying they don't have \"house\" wines.  I clarified that I wanted the featured wine that is on the front page of the wine menu.  In my experience the \"featured\" wines by the glass are generally considered house wines.  \n\nIn other server notes, our water glasses were never refilled, my empty wine glass (1st glass) was never removed, and our dinner was delivered before we were done with our appetizer.  \n\nThe food was very good.

He was tentative, funny, informative about all items on the menu and I am so glad that we had JOHN as our drinks, bread, salad and our main course was served superbly!  After we received our drinks (and before our salad) JOHN suggested we go out on the balcony of the Voodoo Lounge and check out the view.  WOW it was amazing!  we sat out there with our drinks for about 20 minutes.  Taking photos and just enjoying the spectacular sights!  JOHN let us kow that if you eat dinner you have access to the Voodoo Lounge all night.  We told him we had Penn & Teller tickets - so he told us to come back after the show and enjoy the night in the Voodoo Lounge.  How cool is that?  Free entry to a club in Las Vegas.  WOW!\nAs soon as we walked back to our table - JOHN served our salad.  JOHN was on the ball!  Boy, I sure hope Voodoo Steak realizes what a gem JOHN is to have as an employee.  We finished up our meal.  All unbelievably cooked to perfection.  I had the salmon and my husband had the rib eye.  Baked potatoes for our sides.\nWell we knew we had to leave soon as the show was soon upon us.  We didn;t want to go.  We just wanted to stay up there all night.

When we showed up on Saturday, the hostesses never doubted us and they tried really hard to find our reservation.  They were super polite about it, no attitude whatsoever, but there was no reservation anywhere on their system. We checked our email, and there is was - for Friday, the night before!

The scallops were delicious - melt in your mouth! Loved the flavor. Our friends liked their salmon and Rib Eye. Mine was disappointingly ok - the crab was cooked a little too long so it was a little rubbery. There wasn't much cream in the sauce and just needed more flavor. We were starving so no one bothered to complain. We also ordered sides - asparagus, truffle Mac & Cheese and French Fries. The asparagus was too al-dente for my taste, loved the Truffle Mac & Cheese and of course, you can't possible go wrong with Pomme Frits!!! Their selection of bread was good as well.

Since then several new hotels and restaurants have popped up and although the RIO is a nice hotel it's definitely now one of the older ones and so is this restaurant.\n\nI was more than excited to try this place, I was with a few co workers and since we were staying at the RIO, it made sense to have dinner here this evening.  For drinks I enjoyed the sangria which was fabulous followed by a glass of red with dinner, I've heard the witches brew drink is amazing but I was with my boss and co worker so I didn't want to get too crazy :).  The food and the service unfortunately I wasn't impressed with.  I felt very rushed and I really like to sit back and dine for hours upon end at a nice restaurant like this.  I also thought it was extremely expensive, now I don't mind paying $40 for a salmon dish as long as it's truly mouth watering and the side of veggies isn't just 2 pieces of cauliflower.  The one thing I'm picky with is the temperature of food, I like my food piping hot, I don't know what it was this week but everything I had was just warm.\n\nI ordered the salmon dish, the plate was cold so obviously the fish went cold quickly, I even heat my plates in the oven at my own house when I'm cooking myself a hot meal.  We also ordered a few sides including the mushrooms and asparagus which came out 10 minutes after our meal, it would have been nice to have our sides with our meals.  Again these weren't very hot either and by the time they got to me and onto my cold plate they were freezing.  My salmon was okay, nothing special compared to any other piece of salmon I've had, I enjoyed the mushrooms, the wine was good and I have to say the one thing I enjoyed the most was the cracker/pita bread thing that came out with the bread when we arrived.  We didn't have dessert and because we said no to dessert the next thing you know, plates are cleared and the bill is on the table and we were out the door.  One trick I've learned is to always accept a dessert menu as it saves you time from being so rushed out.\n\nThe view is gorgeous and the rooftop upstairs is beautiful and a great spot to have your a picture taken but overall I'm just not that impressed.

He told us he didn't think there would be a problem with those sides, but would double check just to make sure.  He never came back, so we assumed it was fine.  When our food came out, we were served plain, dry, barely warmed up asparagus and green beans.  We asked what happened and he said the almonds in the green beans were brushed with flour and the aioli sauce had flour in it so he had them prepare it without.  While we appreciated that he was looking out for the allergy issue, we asked why didn't he come back and tell us this so we could decide on different sides that were gluten free as the main reason we wanted to try those sides were because of the flavors, not just to be given plain steamed vegetables at $11 each!

Have you ever wandered into a bookstore for one thing and come out with an arm-full?  I do that, a lot.  I can't help myself.  Books I've never head of are cleverly displayed which makes me pick them up and read the jacket and realise that it sounds fabulous, so I buy and subsequently love it.  Now that's an experience you wouldn't have online.\n\nAnyway... the Edinburgh Bookshop manages to serve up the benefits of going to an actual bookstore (paired with incredibly lovely, helpful, and impressively knowledgeable staff - bonus!) with the convenience of shopping online.  By that I mean that they will happily order anything you like.  And, if they can't get it for any reason, they'll let you know how and where you can order it yourself.  \n\nSeeing as it's located directly next to my bus stop, this makes it *more* convenient, and certainly more enjoyable than shopping online.\n\nI'm definitely a convert.", "business_id": "7To7jF3FhnKPin4QaPVCiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-22", "type": "review"}], "state": "EDH", "longitude": -3.2099801, "stars": 5.0, "latitude": 55.9346222, "attributes": {"Parking": {"garage": false, "street": false, "validated": false, "lot": false, "valet": false}, "Accepts Credit Cards": true, "Wheelchair Accessible": true, "Price Range": 3}, "type": "business", "categories": ["Books, Mags, Music & Video", "Shopping", "Bookstores"]}, {"city": "Las Vegas", "review_count": 4, "name": "Dis & Dat Auto Wrecking & Repair", "neighborhoods": ["Sunrise"], "open": true, "business_id": "Ceyd_1ops0GHG_J9ZPKeSg", "full_address": "2635 Bledsoe Ln\nSunrise\nLas Vegas, NV 89156", "hours": {"Monday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}, "Tuesday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}, "Friday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}, "Wednesday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}, "Thursday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}, "Saturday": {"close": "17:00", "open": "08:00"}}, "reviews": [{"username": "Vic", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "r_u8OH4O0lG4jvGXgzexNA", "review_id": "IHx84TQnlKycqDvZmyO9zA", "text": "worse place ever!!!!!! do not buy parts from them!!!!!!!!!!!", "business_id": "Ceyd_1ops0GHG_J9ZPKeSg", "stars": 1, "date": "2014-06-18", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Kimberly", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "b1LYs2rmzINaBLq9AFDn6Q", "review_id": "StQlOw0LTvKCA35RN_tUNA", "text": "While calling around to get estimates for replacement of the right axle we were referred here.

Sometimes the food sucks.  I mean I've been eating IHOP food on and off for many years, and before eating at this particular one I would have bet money that you would seriously have to try to screw it up badly.  Also, sometimes the service sucks.  They forget items, they don't remember your special requests, they may or may not bring you condiments, utensils, or even remember to wipe your table.\n\nWhy then? Why in the world would I give this place four stars?  It's simple.  On Friday and Saturday nights around 2:30, magic happens.  It's generally best to arrive early, say at 2:15 for prime seating.  Around 2:25 the trainwreck begins in earnest.  Liquored up college students shuffle in by the carload.  There will be laughter, tears, raucous and raunchy behavior.  Some will wander off to the bathroom.  Most of them will return.  Random people will start conversations with you.  Some lucky (unlucky?) strangers will hook up.  There may be dancing, singing, even removal of various items of clothing.  You may choose to raise the stakes a little by betting on your favorite contenders for likely drunken behaviors such as, that guy is going to pass out at his table.  Or that girl is coming back from the bathroom with vomit in her hair.\n\nIt's a lot like a bar or club but the music isn't as loud so it's easier to eavesdrop and / or join conversations.  Plus the real fun is in going completely sober.  Sure, I still like to tie one on now and again and I am certainly not always be a saint in public.  Every once in a while though it's fun to step outside of that and imagine how I must look to everyone else who isn't having the good time I'm having.  When I need a long hard look at myself, I find the patrons of this particular IHOP to  be  excellent mirrors. Especially at the aforementioned times.\n\nCome on now, who doesn't enjoy a little schadenfreude with their hashbrowns?", "business_id": "SNpVV5viJ2aPylP6bkAx8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-08", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Emma", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "GjYhx_UBsndqJ5O0P7y3cw", "review_id": "k1mhipgUBlxSf_DhgcN4ug", "text": "I am asking conscientious consumers who believe in voting with their dollars to boycott this establishment because they tow the cars of paying customers.\n\nA week ago me and three friends met at the IHOP (International  House of Pancakes) on Apache and Forrest.   I left a HUGE tip to make up for the fact that we didn't purchase all that much food, and the waiter was quite nice. When one friend arrived at IHOP, he thought we were meeting by my dorm (which is literally across the street) and walking over, so he parked at IHOP, called us and walked across the street. And in less than 30 seconds walked BACK across the street and into IHOP.\n\nHis car was towed WHILE HE WAS INSIDE IHOP. We walked out, couldn't find his car and didn't panic. We knew in our hearts that as PAYING CUSTOMERS, an honest mistake was made and they would take care of us. Nope, not the case. I immediately went back in and asked for the reciept, which the cashier gave me. She was very nice and apologetic and reassuring. As I did that, the one who's car was towed was on the phone with the towing contractor who told him we needed to get a note from IHOP's manager. OK easy enough. So we asked and he began writing the note, and then for whatever reason he called the towing company.\n\nBecause the towing company's payed spotter (you know that this towing is lucrative for them if they pay a spotter to look for students) saw him cross the street he refused to write a note saying that we were paying customers. \n\nI still can't believed this happened. We argued with him for a while, started out quite nice but it degenerated. I swear the manager was smiling for most of the time while telling us \"there was nothing he could do.\" Ultimately he lied to us and said it was the responsibility of the hotel because they had contract with the towing company. So far, we have been unable to resolve this in a reasonable way.\n\nIt kills me how businesses here treat students. Because there are so many of us, they realize that they can treat us poorly and take advantage of us all over the place, and no matter how many they drive away there will always be more students. I feel really powerless about this, I don't know what I can do to fix it except tell everyone what happened. So I am asking you to PLEASE not go to IHOP while they maintain this policy of abusing students. We can fight back by boycotting them!", "business_id": "SNpVV5viJ2aPylP6bkAx8Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-10-18", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Gregory Paul", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "ula4mfuI9HEYb4djfOuE3g", "review_id": "vHNW7VR3ud9A6WTYb6qYpg", "text": "This was a good place with lots of room inside and very clean.

When we pointed out the missing jacket the older male behind the counter asked me if I in fact turned the jacket in to be cleaned. Of course i did. First of all, I know what I brought. Secondly, the drop-off receipt clearly read 4 items to include a TWO PIECE SUIT. There were only 3 items in front of me. \n\nThe female behind the counter stared at me for a minute as if she were trying to see if I was lying. Finally, the male and female began to look for it and what do u know... They found it. On the floor. Under the racks. It was kind of funny watching them climb through the rack, searching. The male picked it up and showed it to us, full of dust and ridiculously wrinkled. The male stated that because the suit jacket was too long (my boyfriend is 6'9\") for the rack, when the jacket came around it brushed over the top of all the boxes that are under the racks causing it to fall. The male offered to brush the dust off and iron it. I just wanted to take it and leave but my boyfriend wanted it fixed right there.\n\nOnce the jacket was finished, the male hung it so we could inspect it. He lifted the plastic and there was dog hair and lint all over it from the beating it took on the floor. My boyfriend asked them to remove the hair with a lint brush or something but the male insisted that the dog hair wasn't dog hair, that it was fibers from inside the jacket and they don't \"do that\". Meaning they don't remove the fibers but they weren't fibers!!! Anyone with eyes could see the difference between fabric fibers and dog hair. I was picking lint and DOG HAIR off the jacket and was showing it to the male. I was so upset!\n\nThe male did offer to re-clean the jacket but at that point even my boyfriend was DONE! \n\nThe male did take $1.75 off of the $11.75 total. \n\nThe main reason for choosing Oasis was because it was so close to my home.

No sending out the clothes to a centralized corporate owned facility, they handle each garment and do the dry cleaning or laundering personally, on site, using their own equipment. This is very respectable and alone is warranting of praise. Adding on top of that their extremely friendly and personable attitudes and demeanors and you truly have a home run. \n\nThe owner manager is a nice gentleman that remembers your name and takes care of you. Even offering to do minor fixes like button repairs and simple seam tear repairs free of charge. His wife does the alterations, and due to some personal medical issues, is no longer able to do more complicated alterations (like taking a jacket in), but is still able to do the basics like opening up or taking in pants, lengthening or shortening inseams, and basic sledge work.

It has a bunch of restaurants I like and ones that I wanted to try, including OT.  So I made a reservation for 7:00 on a Friday and went with my husband. \n\nI didn't even realize that I had made a reservation on a First Friday.  There was a loud party going on in the back and the entire staff seemed a bit flustered catering to them and the normal restaurant crowd.  You'd think they'd have their act together having to deal with First Friday on average of once per month.  Guess not. \n\nWe arrived an hour early in hopes of sitting at the bar to get a feel for the place and take advantage of their happy hour.  This is where the bad experiences started.  I had two glasses of wine and my husband had two top shelf martinis.  When we got the bill, we noticed I had been charged $1 per glass over the price listed in the wine menu, and my husband had been charged full price for the martinis that were supposed to be on happy hour special ($9 each instead of $7).  Very disingenuous, and strike #1.  To the bartender's credit, rather than mess with the computer and get the charges correct, she simply took off one of the glasses of wine, which more than made up for the overcharge.  I wish this had been the only hiccup, but. . . \n\nOnce we were seated at our table, I was overwhelmed by the scent of vanilla.  All of the candles they used on all of the tables were scented!  Anyone that has ever planned a reception with food knows (and every restauranteur should know) that this is a big no-no because the smell of the candles totally alters the taste of the food.  I blew out the candle on our table immediately, but this is strike #2. \n\nSince we had the gift certificate, we decided to go with a three course meal - soups, apps, entrees.   Amazingly, all of the food came out to the table at the same time.  We had a table full of food getting cold as we started on our soup.  Strike #3.  \n\nAs for the food, the french onion soups we had were actually quite good.  The bacon wrapped prawns appetizer was ok, the dipping sauces were nothing special.  My lemon artichoke chicken was also good but my husband's grilled meatloaf, while he enjoyed it, tasted more like Italian sausage.  \n\nUnfortunately, when we got the bill, we again noticed that we had been overcharged on our glasses of wine (different wine than at the bar).  We didn't think much of it this time since we were using the gift certificate anyway.  But here's the icing on the cake - when you use the gift certificate, they add on gratuity based on the original amount of the bill.  Fine, no big deal.  The original bill was $61, so with the $25 certificate it *should* have come to $36 + gratuity.  When we got the revised bill the amount listed $44 and said \"($8 included gratuity)\".  A few days later, checking my bank statement, I saw OT was kind enough to charge us $52. . .they double charged the gratuity!  $16 tip on a $61 meal!  Effectively making the $25 certificate $17!  Strikes #4, 5, and 6.  Unacceptable. \n\nIf you decide to frequent this establishment, I strongly urge you to double and triple check the charges on your bill and pay in cash so they don't have the opportunity to overcharge your card.", "business_id": "3m7khDnqH9QOg8gu3Ymumw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-11-18", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Jeffery", "votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 4}, "user_id": "mSPIqp2ezRlpHofWoYfLvQ", "review_id": "GsIOGloafC1bG1GK8JN18g", "text": "I dunno about the food here as I have not attended during normal business hours.

Instead, I got cheese and over-cooked dough. I hesitate to describe the bottom of my slices as \"black,\" because as a former waiter I know customers always complain that food is blackened if it's even a touch more done than they want. But for real, the bottoms of my slices were the second-blackest thing I'd seen all day.

My experiences with Fremont street thus far had been The Beauty Bar and The Griffin. To say that I wasn't a fan of Fremont Street was an understatement. The Griffin is basically the Blue Martini of hipsters, and Beauty Bar charges a cover to hang out with underage kiddies with fake ID's in a hole in the wall with music so loud that you can't think. Don't Tell Mama is the antithesis of that, it's filled with creative interesting people that are a tad eccentric. We walk in and are surprised to see a piano and a girl belting Take Me or Leave Me from Rent at the front of their mini stage. We both think, okay this is our kinda bar! I ordered a flavored vodka and sprite and Matt had a vodka cranberry, which came out to $13. So definitely not overpriced, you're crazy Matt. I think one of my favorite things about Don't Tell Mama was the fact that the bartenders are the singers. Yes, I got served my Stoli Blackberry and Sprite straight in the middle of  the bartender belting out a song on a wireless mic, AMAZ-ING. Sexual orientation shouldn't matter in a bar, but I will comment that it does have a heavily female vibe. If that bothers you, this probably isn't your place. The music of the night included a couple tunes from Cher, Elton John, Billy Joel, Rush, Rent, and TLC. There was even a patron who belted out some Georgia on my Mind by Ray Charles.Yes they are heavily karaoke, but trust me on this, it's done phenomenally well. Truth be told, no matter how much I like this place I question it's ability to have longevity. It caters to a completely different crowd, it's small, known as a lesbian bar, and is on Fremont Street.

First, we had a cocktail server that came by to bring our drinks, then was never seen again.  The place is TINY! Why even bother to have servers if they're not going to serve you? I've been perfectly content to walk the 3 steps to the bar in the past.  When it was clear she wasn't coming back (despite NOT being one of the featured singers), my friend went to the bar to close our tab.  The bartender then proceeded to try and double charge her!  It took about 10-15 min plus the intervention of another friend to get the bill straight.\n\nMaybe I'm a country bumpkin who doesn't know how the biz works, but scamming the customers by intentionally overcharging is ridiculous.

And walking out of a bar at 1-2 AM by yourself in the sketchy area that is around Fremont isn't my favorite.\n\nIf you want a low-key night, fine piano men, and to hear the most amazing voices, check out Don't Tell Mama. Fridays and Saturdays are the best nights and the place can get packed! Dre is my favorite bartender and her voice is addictive. \n\nI am surprised no one has mentioned this yet, but the bar is open mic. If you have an inkling to sing, then go ahead and do so. I've done it once, while I was under the influence. It's a bit intimidating because the bartenders voices are out of this world, or as I tell Dre, \"You have the voice of an angel.\" But no matter how horrid you are, no one will laugh you off stage.\n\nWhen in doubt and you want to try a new place, Mama's is the place to be. Grab a couple of friends and come on down, sing along, and have a yabadabadoo time!", "business_id": "0_J4y0aEmtuzgdsH2OfWQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-18", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Katie", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "KBUWNtzIYsT4kq_4Uq8_PA", "review_id": "ZvQ0U8Rz4j6uTC27itdJpw", "text": "I discovered a little place called Don't Tell Mama back in April 2009, about a month after they opened their doors down on Freemont East.\n\nLet me tell you, it was love at first visit. \n\nThis gem is packed full of talent - not to mention, that talent happens to be the same people pouring your drinks.

After playing Billie Jean (another great sing along song), the piano player invited one of the bartenders up to sing.  Well, she started singing some musical/opera I have never heard of and kept singing song after unrecognizable song. There were some older folks in there... maybe they requested it?  But they didn't seem to be paying attention or singing along.  Anyway, after the third song, my friend and I couldn't take it anymore and left.

This girl is AMAZING. No, I'm not exaggerating. I live in the live music capital of the world where we host ACL and SXSW every year, and she's given the best performance I've ever heard live. \nCarly is pretty good too- she sounds like Christina Aguilera :P\n\nAnnnyyway, we took a small group of friends here after our wedding on a Saturday night, and everyone loved it. It's about a 10-15 minute drive from the Strip ($13 cab ride), and it's a refreshing change from the hotel clubs where stilettos are pretty much mandatory. I wore my short wedding dress and flip-flops and the boys still stayed in their tuxes; some people were a bit more dressed up but there were also groups of people in tshirts and jeans. \n\nPros:\n-No cover\n-Drinks are reasonably priced. We opened up a tab for everyone in our group, and getting 6 people solidly drunk by the end of the night cost less than $300 including the 20% tip that we left. \n-Talent is phenomenal. Our group probably left over $100 in tips for just the singers/piano guy by the end of the night, but it was worth it. They sang a lot of our requests- Dre even pulled up some of our songs on her phone and winged it when she didn't know it well. \n-Owners are so nice. It was packed when we arrived at around 11:30 or midnight, and the owner made us a table in the back corner and moved us to the very front as soon as a table opened up.\n\nCons:\n-You have to get there early or really late for good seating. \n-They only take reservations if you're planning on showing up between 8-9pm.\n-The singing bartenders didn't know any of my first 8 wedding song requests :( I guess it's because it was mostly Texas Country. Although there were a couple Nashville songs and a random Sister Hazel song...Oh well, I had to go more mainstream or older (like Journey or Bon Jovi) if I wanted to hear something.\n\nOh and on a random note, I don't know what Brett is talking about below.

Small - very small, teeny-tiny small - but well worth either the wait or coming back/in early.

Most of the 15 songs we heard were mid-70s t0 late-90s pop standards, but Dre did an amazing version of Pasty Cline's \"Walking After Midnight\", which worked well for everyone listening. Patrons are encouraged to sing as well, with turns taken by writing your name and song on a cocktail napkin, given to the pianist. As with other reviewers, I'd suggest getting there are around 8 p.m., so that your evening starts at Don't Tell Mama, as our attempt to enter at 11 p.m. the night before was unsuccessful. Also, the posted signs note that no one under 21 is admitted to the bar, so keep this in mind when planing your visit.

Since my candle is nearly burned out, all you get is a bullet point review of Don't Tell Mama.\n\nVibe - Laid back, funky, old school, micro-lounge, dark \n\nClientele - A good mix of locals and tourists of all ages \n\nPiano bar comparrison - As a piano bar, this is a nice diversion from the strip-based dueling piano bars, which tend to go off the rails trying to dupe tipsy patrons into paying \"points\" to play a particular style of music (such as country western vs. rock).  For them, it's a gimmick that works, over-and-over $.    \n\nAnother difference is they let you sing at Don't Tell Mama, if you're so inclined.  At times, it can become a bit of a piano bar karaoke party.\n\nEven though I liked this place, I still prefer the scene at Harrah's on a good night when the twins are playing and the drinks are flying fast and furious.  That place can be an absolute riot.  \n\nSinging bartenders - This is a pretty cool entertainment twist.  They make your cocktail and then belt out a tune.  I'll take a jack n' coke please, followed by YOU singing Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" (because it's a crowd pleaser and the female bartender has excellent pipes).\n\nSeating - Overall, this is a pretty small place.  There are stools around the bar and a number of smaller tables (possibly for 40-50 people).  For some reason, the stools have little turnover.  The tables seem to cycle out about every 20-30 minutes (later in the evening).  Grab a drink (at discount Fremont Street prices) and wait around.  You will eventually find a seat.     \n\nFaux star factor - When we were there, a guy who called himeself \"Jack\" was on a stool at the bar.  He had a Nicholson look about him.  He wore some brown Original Ray-Ban Wayfarers.  He was clad in a white dress shirt accompanied by a cream colorerd sportcoat (and rocking a stylish black silk pocket square).  \n\nJack was burning nails and had visble smoky haze around him.  He made song requests for old school stuff like Frank Sinatra's \"Luck Be a Lady.\"  When his songs played, he got animated and did a little prancing.  Now, while he wasn't \"Easy Rider\" Jack, he was a cool Vegas local version who put on an authentic side-show, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nAsk Jack and he'll tell you Don't Tell Mama is As Good as it Gets.\n\nHALLOWEEN UPDATE - \n\nJust back from Halloween in Las Vegas.  After negotiating a sea of Walking Dead on Fremont Street, we pit-stopped at Don't Tell Mama.  Sweet baby Jesus.  Pulling up a stool next to ghouls, goblins, ghosts, scary Satan, sexy Satan, sexy cop and the guy next to me in a gorilla suit was surreal.  This was like NYE on steroids.  Put Halloween on Fremont Street on your list of things to do.  Oh, one more thing.  The singing bartender who served us was a better version of Ariana Grande, clad in a black & white liquid vinyl mini dress and rocking the requisit cat ears.", "business_id": "0_J4y0aEmtuzgdsH2OfWQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-04-11", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Johnny", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "jQFozqyDJxRWuai1coCOUg", "review_id": "N1jtTg4e80Au5ty5Blza2A", "text": "Best White Russians in town, and in my opinion, the western world.

You're not going to be blown away by the hundreds of thousands the owners spent sprucing the place up just for your delicate sensibilities, 'cause they didn't.  It's small and dark with tables and booths along the wall.  Looks like a dive bar.  Feels like a dive bar.  LOVED IT!  We went on a Wednesday night about 8:30 and stayed for a couple of hours.  Started slow and started filling up more by about 9:30\n\nYes, there is a full bar.  We stuck with beer so I won't be doing a review on the drinks beyond saying that the service was fast and friendly.   I liked all of the staff there.  The Blue Moon bottles were $6 but there's no cover charge.  They cut off one guy who was obviously toasted and needed to leave, but without any fuss.  It's nice to see things handled well.   \n\nThe piano player, Kenny Davidson, was top notch.  Ran through the standards you'd expect, Billy Joel, Elton John, Beatles, and such.  Able to handle anything the audience threw at him.  Fantastic, especially on the Elton John songs.  You can't have a piano bar without a fantastic pianist, and Kenny was excellent. \n\nThe bartenders could sing their tails off.  They did a number of covers that I recognized but couldn't tell you the names of the artists beyond a Miriah Carey and a Cher number.  They were having a blast performing and really do have the chops for it.  Very much appreciated!  \n\nNow, things came off the rails with the professionals dropping in for a little play time.  One of Las Vegas' crown jewels, Savanah Smith, dropped in and did a few numbers. She started with a piece from Wicked that was as good as what we saw on Broadway several years ago.  A jazz mash up followed that was even better.  I haven't been been blown away like that by a vocalist in years and I'll freely admit to being a music snob.\n\nA little later, an a cappella quartet, These Guys Acapella, dropped in for a set.  Again, Wow!  Looking them up later, I saw that they're out of L.A.  Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.\n\nDon't Tell Mama is one of those places that you don't know what you're going to get, but it's going to be good, for the most part.  One caveat: They do allow people in the audience to tip the pianist and get up and sing.  Two of the folks were awful, but fortunately not too hard to ignore.  \n\nGood mix of tourists and locals.  Just a fun time all the way around.  It's hip little spot where you can let your hair down.  You don't know who or what you're going see, and that's part of the fun.\n\nThe immediate area is fine.  The surrounding area is rough.  I'd park in the Fremont Experience parking or at the public parking lot next to the Container Park.  I wouldn't park down some side street ten minutes away to save on paying for parking.  There are plenty of bars, restaurants, and casinos all around the area, so it's not going to be difficult to make an evening of it. \n\nOne suggestion would be to bring enough cash to tip often.  The bartenders bring around the tip bowl after their performances and push for tips for the pianist, too.", "business_id": "0_J4y0aEmtuzgdsH2OfWQw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-09", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Meghann", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "J_HZwr05l6dbHiQbJpYmtw", "review_id": "IzSh2rq4kgjP826r7Si-Xw", "text": "After a debaucle of epic proportions at Park on Fremont (#parkonfremont) across the street, our large group of 30+ took our business to the always awesome Don't Tell Mama!!!\n\nThe owner, Joanna Pham was behind the bar along with an amazing bartender and singer Brintannia.

My wife and I were excited to try this place as we live in North Scottsdale and wanted some new places to go. Got there early after dinner and sat down at the bar for a glass of wine. We had been at the bar about 45 minutes and just ordered our 2nd glass of wine. My wife went to the bathroom and while I was sitting at the bar the bouncer came over to me and told me I could no longer sit where I had been sitting and was going to remove my bar stools at the bar. \n\nI told him I thought that was rude, that my wife and I don't want to stand with our wine and that we didn't see the need to remove us from our seats. At that moment without any explanation..... seriously.... no more conversation other than those few words.... he told me my choice was to get off the stools or leave the bar. I looked at him like he was nuts. I had never been talked to that way in any establishment. I told him I didn't quite understand why he would want me to leave the bar for discussing that I was not satisfied with him pulling bar stools away from me, while my wife and I were drinking $18 glasses of wine. He never offered to relocate me, offer me a drink for any inconvenience. He just told me the bar stools no longer work here as the bar gets crowded and to get up.\n\nAt that point he removed the stools from underneath me and took them away. The bartender - who up till that point had given us great service, asked me if I was \"ok\". I told him no I was upset that the ****head bouncer was treating us like that. At that point, one of the other bouncers heard my complaint...yes complaint.... and both bouncers came back and said I was no longer welcome at the bar. So far I had not raised my voice, was not causing a scene was literally trying to discuss why I was being treated so poorly. The bouncer threatened to call the cops on me. Which I told him to do as I have not done anything wrong and already told him I would leave as soon as my wife returned from the bathroom. I also asked for my credit card back and the drinks to be removed from my tab that had just been poured. I don't think I should pay for $18 glasses of wine that I didn't get to drink because the bouncer has a god complex. My card was handed back to me at that time, without them voiding the transaction...guess I will be calling my credit card company. At that time my wife came back from the restroom and could not believe what was happening. As she tried to engage the bouncer to get information again he just told us to leave\n\nI then told the bouncer we would leave, but he blocked our exit and didn't want us walking out the front door. He wanted us to leave by the back elevator exit. I told him...no... that my wife and I wanted to go somewhere else and didn't need to be escorted out that we would leave without causing any issues. That was not good enough for them they surrounded us and made us go out the back entrance. The whole time we were in the elevator they said we were unreasonable and that I should not have called the bouncer a name. Seriously.....you treat me like that when I am spending good money in your restaurant and minding my own business and literally insult me for asking for some common service and some decency. It's not like my wife and I were some obnoxious drunks. We are business professionals that were just hoping to have a good night out on the town. Obviously, we won't be going back to Narcisse. As any new hot bar they will probably do well as \"the place\" to go, but I hope their run is short lived so I can get a new establishment in the Scottsdale Quarter that treats me well for my business.", "business_id": "W0eocyGliMbg8NScqERaiA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-23", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Danielle", "votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 8, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "oy6fdscGSXY2gzRqF9pZxg", "review_id": "JVxHdxFTQZ57itby7kchzg", "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to have a drink after dinner at the Quarter.

Right about that same time, the ropes came up outside (huh? It's only 8pm and it's not even crowded) and the spiky-haired guys in pinstripe suits and black gloves (yes, gloves - and I think it was probably about 60 degrees so it wasn't for warmth... maybe it was a Diane Keaton inspired fashion statement?) came out and swarmed around the entrance. So much for my theory of a cute, unpretentious bar. Maybe they were preparing for a busy night, but the outside was empty, do you really need 5 guys standing around?

So don't think this is a harsh review due to their location. \n\nI was at Narcisse last night with a group of 6 at a reserved booth. Things went smoothly enough in seating us. I was immediately impressed by the decor of the place and excited to try their menu. My friend and I pored over the extensive bubbly list and the food menu quickly. My friend suggested that we get the chef's choice meats, cheeses platter. After a few questions, we went ahead with the platter and a bottle of sparkling rose'. Everything was great! The platter was large enough for everyone at the table to try something. \n\nAs the food part of the evening was wrapping up for our group, we decided to mix and mingle. The crowd made for some great people watching! I was enjoying the show! The music was good and upbeat and created a great vibe. My tootsies were hurting a bit so we decided to head back to the booth to chill for a bit. This is when it gets silly. \n\nI was sitting in the booth with 3 other people and we were watching a bouncer and I assume a manager trying to arrange and rearrange a table and chairs right in front of our booth. I sat back in amusement at first as the Benny Hill theme song played in my head. I was thinking to myself \"This table is blocking booth traffic.\" Well, the two employees decided to move the table a little further away from the booths and into the traffic that walks into the establishment; a very high traffic area. I shook my head and thought the show was over. No. A hostess with a clipboard comes over and says \"Hi guys. I have had these booths reserved for, like, two weeks in advance and need to move you to that table. I'll give you a bottle of champagne for your inconvenience.\" I didn't object. I didn't say anything. I just got up and moved. Well, our booth was a booth for 6, the table was a booth for 4. So as we were trying to arrange for more chairs, if possible, I watched a server run into our makeshift table setting, look annoyed, then climb OVER two of the empty chairs at our table. Then I see another patron walk into the establishment, and slam right into one of the other chairs on the other side of the table. A bouncer comes over to tell us that we can't move tables before being told by another bouncer that we were ok. This table IS NOT supposed to be here. I felt like we were in the way and we were. On top of that, I'm watching as another makeshift \"reserved\" table is being arranged in the already cramped area. I had enough. I told my friend that I wanted to leave and started saying my goodbyes. \n\nMy friend had been a bar manager for a large establishment for many years, so he went to speak to the Manager to inform him of the tomfoolery with the tables. I walked up in the middle of the conversation and the Manager was asking us to stay and was apologizing profusely. I told him I respected the business and understood that things were crazy, but booting people out of a booth and putting them at a table that blocked the flow of traffic was hazardous and not professional at all. I also explained that we were paying customers that had bought approx 5 bottles of champagne and food, so we weren't schlumps. The Manager thanked me for my understanding and wanted to let me know that \"after 10 or so, the place becomes more of a nightclub, so tables are tough and we're trying to accommodate everyone who wants a reserved table\". Ok then they should pull all the tables then and not call themselves a Lounge. Or they should LIMIT the number of tables they reserve. He again asked us to stay and he'd get more chairs over and buy us a drink. I told him that the chairs weren't necessary (where the heck were they going to put them??) and that we would stay for the drink. He insisted on trying to move more chairs over, which caused more of a jam. We insisted that the chairs weren't needed and he took them away. Our drinks? Ordered but never delivered after 35 minutes. I just stood by observing and saw another server run into a chair at our table and pick it up and move it to another part of the place. I just laughed and told my friend we were outta there. \n\nAt what point is it a good business decision to sacrifice quality for quantity? Do you try to accommodate everyone who wants a table or limit the number and keep the service integrity high? Do you accommodate paying customers who are willing to continue drinking and eating or bump them for a table who bought one bottle of alcohol? \n\nI think Narcisse has potential. It's not quite there yet. I guess I just expect more out of a bubble lounge. All the pieces are there! Maybe I will go back after they work out the kinks.", "business_id": "W0eocyGliMbg8NScqERaiA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-06", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Lisa", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "qXfAhYxpSzkQfyS48OcC0Q", "review_id": "3HaRUSAjq7fwhU6y5bJJ_Q", "text": "I went to Narcisse a few nights ago with my boyfriend and was very satisfied! \n\nThe decor is awesome - very unique - the bubbles from the ceiling, the decorative lattice and the dramatic vintage black & white style.

Myself and two girlfriends came in on a Thursday for a quick bite to eat and some champagne before attending another event. We were seated by one hostess at one table, wherein another hostess came back almost immediately and asked us to move to another table because that table was actually reserved. So, no biggie, we moved to another table. The decor is unique in that it is clean and modern, while adding artistic flairs in all the right spots. It's kind of a modern-boudoir fusion. \n\nAnyhow, we get to the next table, and take a look over the menu. It's a great menu, offering a lot of small plates and a few entrees as well. There is definitely something for everyone on the menu...that is if they happen to have it that night. Our waitress came over, and the first three things I tried to order, they were out of that night. The waitress apologetically stated \"We have only been open a month, and we are already switching things around on the menu\". Fantastic, I understand. The menu should then be re-printed to reflect those changes. We finally settle on a few items, and order a non-vintage Tat. The prices are expensive, but that is to be expected in a champagne lounge, and I didn't find them to be astronomically so. Once the menu is settled I'm sure that things will run more smoothly, and the food we did get was very good. As to be expected, the champagne list is phenomenal. \n\nJust as I am getting finally getting comfortable after moving tables and going through several options before ordering, a girl comes over and introduces her as one of the people in charge of memberships. I would have listened to her, but she was dressed so inappropriately and unprofessionally, revealing far too much for a work environment. I understand that Narcisse is a club environment at night, but more than anything your staff should always exude class in a champagne lounge. I am not interested in seeing your staff member's nipples through her dress, which was short enough that she hopefully didn't need to bend over for anything. There are other clothing options to still show off the figure you have, while still remaining classy and professional, especially while trying to interest customers in a membership.

This event came in the form of winning a free brunch for four via their Facebook page.  Yes, Narcisse wants to give back to its fans!\n\nBut before I waffle on about its divine brunch, I want to talk a little about the space and concept.\n\nNarcisse was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection after rejecting the advances of a saucy nymph.  Here, the leather and damask-esque decor remind one of walking into a Parisian socialite's boudoir...evidenced by the ornate chandeliers, larger than life hand mirror on the wall, and the high backed chairs that welcome you to languish in bubbles.  There are sexy sayings that are interspersed throughout the lounge - my personal favorite being Mark Twain's \"One holds a bottle of red wine by the neck, a woman by the waist, and a bottle of Champagne by the derriere  .\"  This is just the type of place for people that love sexy sultry, that love themselves?\n\nBack to Sunday Brunch.  Start out with the $10 bottomless bubbles per person.  This does not come with a mixer, so your orange juice or peach nectar will need to be ordered separately.  \n\nTheir signature brunch sandwhich is the aptly named \"Dom\" the don of breakfast sandwhiches.  Grilled turkey, prosciutto, fried egg, fresh tomatoes, manchego, avocado,and mayo, served with their flavorful house potatoes.  For $8, this was and is a fantastic value.  I could hardly fit it into my mouth, but once I met with success I savored every bite.\n\nNarcisse also has a number of Benedict selections such as the short rib and tenderloin.  They are served on a brioche bun, topped with 2 poached eggs, and drizzled with a lemony truffle hollandaise sauce.  Beautiful!\n\nOther items on the menu include a plethora of omelets such as the \"Lil piggy\" (with serrano ham, tender pork belly, crispy bacon, chives, and manchego) as well as German apple pancakes and waffles.\n\nBut there is so much more to this venue than brunch.\n\nYou can enjoy happy hour, dinner, and late night here with their full menu.\n\nThere are an assortment of starters such as fries and sauce (choose from truffle oil, red curry ketchup, horseradish mayo) or smoky bleu chips (bleu cheese, fresno chilis, hot sauce).  There are esoteric selections such as the cocoa truffle chicken drums (dry rub chicken drumettes) or more champagne friendly choices such as cheese and meat platters, a smoked salmon platter, pretzel logs and cheese fondue (i love these!) or a more decadent grilled white prawn starter.\n\nAlthough I have only sampled one main course, the \"N Burger\" with sirloin, short rib, manchego, and cucumber, the list of offerings here is  impressive:  ranging from Chilean Sea Bass to Beef Tenderloin.\n\nBut this is not just a champagne lounge, this location offers a high tea experience as well.  Tea time is Tuesday-Friday at 2pm.  Tea infusions are provided by Tea Forte for $6.   You can order tea over ice such as white ginger pear, or hot tea such as coco truffle or green mango peach.\n\nThe tea bite sliders are popular and welcome here, because for $3-$4 each you can sample a variety of delectable bites with your tea such as smoked salmon, cheesesteak, grilled cheese, grilled pbj, ham and havarti, and more.  Bruschetta is also well represented here for a selection of 3 for $15.  (artichoke tapenade, brie, black fig, tuna tartare, asparagus, and tomato confit, to name a few)\n\n\nLadie's night is every Thursday, and it's 50% off all drinks for ladies.  There is always a DJ here, even during Sunday brunch, so the vibe is hip and sexy.\n\nIndustry Night is every Sunday from 6p-Close.  ($3 bubbles by the glass, $3 domestic beers, $5 rock star vodkas and there are some specials on bites and toasts)\n\nDuring Narcisse's Happy Hour, receive 50% off well drinks and $5 bubbles, Sunday-Thursday from 2p-7p.  \n\nWith over 75 varietals of champagne, you can truly get to know the beauty of bubbly.  Get a VIP membership so your first bubbly is always free, and all other drinks are 50% off.\n\nThank you, Kyu Utsunomiya and the staff at Narcisse for their hospitality and unique experience that you have brought to North Scottsdale!", "business_id": "W0eocyGliMbg8NScqERaiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-27", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Sarah", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "lKAr9jH7rfpN8YuOOZyHDw", "review_id": "LICvT0wDYXep1z0yhVjwRQ", "text": "Amazing food and champagne.

I did not go for dinner.  With a crew of 8, I went to the Sunday Brunch.  $10.00 bottomless champagne. I repeat $10.00 bottomless refills.  Okay truth be told it's sparkling wine but who cares.  They refill pretty regularly.  You'll be tipsy enough that you won't care that they charge $12.00 a carafe for juice in the event you want to make your own Bellini or Mimosa.  \nThe brunch menu is pretty varied and is surprisingly reasonable.  The scones are mini-scones and are delicious.  It does come with Devonshire cream and jam on the side as they should.  The eggs benedict are some of the best.  Truffled hollandaise was a nice touch.  Go for the regular eggs benedict and not necessarily the short ribs.  The regular ones really are the best flavored.  The bacon is good, if you want to be really decadent go for the pork belly.  It is fatty goodness.\nThe stuffed french toast was more of a large warm jelly-doghnut, not in a bad way.  But if you like decadent French toast go for the french toast at Frank and Albert's.\nThe vibe is very Vegas, or to compare to a place locally, think of Modern Steak at Fashion Square.

I loved you at the first mention of \"champagne lounge\".  Finally went to check it out with 3 other girlfriends for their $10 bottomless bubbles brunch on a Sunday - how could you NOT love $10 bottomless bubbles right?!\n\nWell, unfortunately the experience was a little disappointing (hence only 3 stars).  They advertise that they pour a Mumm for their bottomless bubbles.  A girlfriend even confirmed this when she was there one night before our brunch, that yes in fact they pour a Mumm.\n\nWell, guess what, no Mumm.  They poured a random sparkling wine from I believe WA (not even CA!).  For sparkling wine snobs like myself and my girlfriends, this was a little off-putting from the start. I mean, we're not uber snobs or anything, but if you promise a Mumm, don't pour some no-name sparkling from WA!?\n\nI will say however that they kept those bubbles flowing.  The server would come refill our glasses before they got empty, so that's a redeeming star.\n\nHowever I can't say there was anything redeeming about the food.  3 out of the 4 of us got cold food (when it should have been hot).  I am REALLY picky about the temperature of my food, so this really was a let down for me.  If the food had been at a proper temp, it would have been quite delicious.\n\nWhat I DO like about the place... the decor is beautiful.  I can imagine the place is stunning at night, but even during the day it was just gorgeous.  The prices were very reasonable - $10 for bottomless bubbles is a steal, (even if some random bubbles from WA!) & the brunch menu items were all reasonable, around $10-14.\n\nAll in all I like the place, and I'll be back to give them another shot.  $10 bottomless bubbles will keep me coming back I think.  :)", "business_id": "W0eocyGliMbg8NScqERaiA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-29", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Billy", "votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}, "user_id": "mym5tXZoZCbuPCYQzI5Ysg", "review_id": "xFJS6K89iux80grU5lOiPg", "text": "Narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being narcissistic is a good thing.  The decor has these decorative, novelty mirrors on the walls because Narcissus, blah blah blah.  Thing is, I don't think they're being ironic or making any sort of comment on society being so shallow, I think it's legitimately like a very \"greed is good\" kind of admission of character.  It's not satire.  It's Scottsdale.\n\nThe color scheme is purple.  Purple, purple everywhere.  As such, I felt like I was in that one scene in Batman (1989) where the Joker poisons everyone and Kim Bassinger has to put on that red gas mask.  I've spent a lot of time describing what the place looks like, much more than I typically do, but I feel like it is an important part of the overall experience of coming here.\n\nLook, for $10, you get bottomless \"bubbles,\" which... I thought was adorable that they kept saying \"bubbles!\" but it turns out that at these kinds of places, everyone thinks they're a champagne expert, which is kind of funny because it's $10, so if they don't say bubbles or something adorable, people will get pissed.  If you wanted to have classy sparkling wine, $10 would be the smartest use of money since Steve Jobs invested in Pixar.  There's no need to complain unless you think that your snob muscle is getting flabby.  \n\nEverything else is reasonably priced, too.  My breakfast burrito was pretty damn big and cost something like $9.  Don't get me wrong.  It was bland.  It certainly wasn't bad, but it was like a rough approximation of a breakfast burrito and executed without all the love.\n\nI wouldn't recommend coming here unless your mission, really, is to have a group of people get kind of sauced in the morning and have some laughs, plug your gut with some food and probably pass out a couple hours later by a pool.", "business_id": "W0eocyGliMbg8NScqERaiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-30", "type": "review"}, {"username": "M.", "votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "EKeVTzW5n6BrpHfedC739Q", "review_id": "8_M7AWKgu7PgzHAPpQCPEw", "text": "Beware fo the bouncers.

It did not take long before my hypothesis proved incorrect because it turned out that a larger portion of my drinks weight was resting on nothing other than fresh Arizona air. The glass tipped over and began to spill my rum and diet all over the beautiful white couch. I used my Jedi reflexes (that ironically failed me a moment ago) to catch the glass before it could fall towards the floor and possibly shatter. None the less, most of my drink ended up spilling all f'ing over the place.\n\nWithin seconds a security guard was at my side with a tiny flashlight directing other members of the staff to begin cleaning everything up.

The moment we walked into this place I sensed an air of pretension.\n\nWe were meeting friends for what I had hoped would be a wonderful evening of catching up.  Unfortunately, the techno music thumping from the speakers overhead pretty much ruled that out.  Perhaps a younger crowd (I'm a young 54) enjoys music that allows you to hear only the words that your date utters between the electronic bass notes, but I really prefer to hear everything that someone is taking the time to share with me.\n\nWhat should one think of a so-called champagne lounge that is out of your first choice of bubbly?  It's not like I chose an obscure or rare bottle of champagne.  I selected Schramsburg Blanc de Blanc, a very delicious, but readily available non-vintage California sparkling. There is no reason to run out of such a wine.\n\nThe food was also nothing to speak of.  Early on a Friday evening they were already out of the tenderloin carpacio.  How do you run out of tenderloin carpacio? Did the slicer break down, or did you really run out of meat suitable to eat unless cooked through? The chilled white prawns were good, but those are pretty hard to get wrong. Don't think by their presence on the happy hour menu that you're getting a good deal.  They sell them for $3 per, and so if you get four you save a whole dollar.  Wow!  The grilled vegetable platter that we shared was pretty good.\n\nThe couple of things that I would highly NOT recommend are the cheese plate and the bacon wrapped matzo balls.  A couple of the cheeses on the plate were OK, but most of them were nothing special.  No brie, no triple creme, no bleu.  There was one cheese that tasted like the low fat mozzarella that I use to make an ordinary pizza.  It was not worth the price that we paid.

With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like \"our god, eternal light...\", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.\n\nAnyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy.

I don't even know where to begin.\n\nThey keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here.  It's gorgeous.  The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post-modern.  I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows... so I am.  I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC...  that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building.\n\nI digress to an absurd degree...the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here.  I crave it often  it's that good.  The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo.  I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy.  Really, nothing here is bad - I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good.  They're \"real\" pierogies.  Delicious.  The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu.  Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated.  I've never had a bad meal here.\n\nThe Pious Monk beer is a must.  A must!  But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale.  They make it all right there.\n\nThe ice cream is so good - I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal.\n\nAmazing.

The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great. \n\n2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer. \n\nCons; \n1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, \"for the pain.\" \n\n2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting \"pierogie of the day\" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve. \n\n3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you. And you should be happy you are not like them. \n\n\n\nDespite all this, it is a really really pretty church! Good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. Office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. Your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-10-09", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Lori", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "3z6tnZUVFJaTNEp30SIKIA", "review_id": "Ohv6fimjXXXk9I06YhBVeQ", "text": "came here on a trip and i found this place on yelp. it sounded like a fun place to try.

I'm not very familiar with Pittsburgh, but this place was somewhat out of the way.  It didn't have many interesting things around it.  Basically it's a bar/brewery built into an old abandoned church.\n\nThe place has been restored and is truly beautiful inside, with gorgeous stained glass windows, church pews, alter, and of course dining tables.  \n\nWe sat down and I watched as 4 of the waitstaff walked by without acknowledging out existence.  It turns out one of the waitstaff that ignored us, was our waiter.  Eventually he stopped by and took our drink order.  I ordered the Mexican Mole Stout, which was pretty good.  As the name suggests, it is a stout with mole spices.  I like stouts and love spicy food, so this was a must try.  As I said, it was good, but far from refreshing, so I suggest a glass of water with it.  \n\nAfter some time, our waiter again decided he should stop by and take a food order.  We both ordered the Shinkasa Cheese Steak because I was after all in PA...not Philly, but PA nonetheless.  When it finally arrived the sandwich was very good, but overpriced at $11 for it's size.  The fries portion was also small, but they were not that great anyway.\n\nWe waited again for the bill after completing our meals.  I would have actually ordered another beer because I wanted to try another of their varieties, but our waiter never returned.

They have a selection of staples that are all quite tasty and also rotate some seasonals in.

The pierogies were a bit too greasy and not as flavor-filled as I've had them (we tried both the traditional and \"untraditional\" which on that day were bratwurst and sauerkraut filled). We also shared the risotto lollipops which were very nice (the sauce was the highlight) and the sweet potato fries which were nothing too spectacular. \n\nBut oh, OHHH, the main course. I got the smoked pork chop with the beet BBQ sauce of the Oktoberfest menu, and it was memorable. The sweet sauce and the perfectly smoked chop were an amazing combination. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were exactly what the dish needed to balance out and the portions were very generous. \n\nDessert we shared German chocolate cake, pumpkin bread pudding, and black forest cheese cake - all were wonderfully done. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bread pudding, very warm and homey, and the texture of the cheesecake was perfectly light thanks to the ricotta cheese. \n\nI wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because the appetizers were just an OK-start to what turned into a fabulously memorable meal in a fun atmosphere that I will suggest anyone passing through Pittsburgh check out.

When you do enter inside it really has an amazing ambiance. The stained glass has been kept and some of the pews as well. The large brewing casks against the wall and in the back fit well with the cavernous interior.\n\nThey had some great choices of their own beer and priced very reasonably considering the microbrew quality. I chose the stout which had chocolate tones with a bit of coconut, and no kidding the first sip I had made me think I was drinking a Mound's candy bar!\n\nThey had a choice of choosing from their dining menu or their bar menu. I chose the BBQ chicken slaw melt. It was a a good size chicken breast that was juicy topped with cole slaw, and melted provolone cheese, and bacon :) Yum!\n\nIt seemed everyone else enjoyed their meals as well, although the buffalo burger seemed a tad small.\n\nOur server was great. He even brought individual checks for our group of 10.\n\nAlthough it's not in the most convenient location it is well worth the trip to go out of your way to get here.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-04", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Brian", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "hP0o98uETWZUDFeTwcvtKg", "review_id": "_uyERiiGKSGKRiuXWf-B0w", "text": "I give them an A on creativity and a C on execution.

There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.\n\nWe started with the \"Nontraditional Pierogies\" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.\n\nWe also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.\n\nFor an entree we had the \"Cinco Formaggio\" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.\n\nWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff.

He suggested the Church Brew Works as the venue, with the caveat that he has found their beers to be rather uneven, their food to be suitable, and the location to be quite remarkable.  I had heard about the Church Brew Works before, and I was eager to try out this restaurant.\n\nMy supervisor was correct when it comes to the beer.  I had a pint of the Heavenly Hefe Weizen, which I found to be rather mediocre.  It was a bit watery for my taste, and there was a flavor I couldn't pick out that seemed a bit off.  For our second round, we chose the Pipe Organ Pale Ale.  This brew had an assertive hoppy essence that was quite enjoyable.  It was pleasantly bitter, and definitely the better of the two beers that I tried.  Compared to other pale ales, though, it was simply OK.\n\nWe split the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza, which was quite good.  The crust acquired a nice flavor in the brick oven and was crispy.  Toppings were fresh, although I found the grilled chicken to be underseasoned and the chorizo to be a bit bland as well.  I was expecting a spicier sausage.  On the whole, though, the pizza was good.  It was the perfect amount of food for two strapping young men to share.  At $15.50, I thought the price was fair for the amount and quality of food.\n\nThe real star at the Church Brew Works is the building.  It is clearly a unique setting, and it was a lot of fun to enjoy a few beers at this location.  For a Wednesday evening, it was quite busy so they have clearly built up a following.

From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.\n\nOn a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.\n\nAlong with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.\n\nIf you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit.

I have to say though, maybe my expectations were too high. \n\nThe entire point of going was for a friend's birthday gathering. An initial party of maybe 15.

After sitting for 15 minutes we down graded the party to 12 as some people hadn't shown. We grabbed some Pumpkin Stouts and waited another 30 minutes before downgrading to the 9 of us that had shown up and we still waited nearly 10 minutes more. \n\nBeing under some time constraints this really put a damper on the evening. Although after the almost 50 minute wait we walked through the restaurant which is lovely with gorgeous high ceilings, a festive air, and a glass wall behind the altar through which you can see some of the brewing happening. We were seated on the altar which provides an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and apologetic for the wait. We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them. The food though, this is where I was really turned off from ever coming back for a meal. \n\nThey have two menus; a regular and a pub menu. The regular is very pricey and the pub menu is moderate to somewhat pricey. We all ended up ordering from the pub menu and while the food tasted good I don't think it was worth the 8$ - 12$ a pop.

Everything seems as original as possible, from the stained glass windows, to the paint on the weathered walls. The owners seem to have gone to great pains to preserve the condition of the church as much as they possibly could. The bar and much of the seating is made from the original pews; the brass tubes of the pipe organ sit inert and silent on the mezzanine. \n\nAdded to the original, traditional accouterment are the latter-day additions: Delicious in their sacrilege, gleaming copper brew tanks occupy the chancel front-and-center, previous home of the altar. Apropos; what better deity for a brewpub? Storage tanks for the final product serry behind the bar; Low half-walls divide the nave into discrete sections without being obtrusive or breaking the flow of the room; a restaurant, like a church, is meant to be a place of gathering, socializing. \n\nAs I went during the night time on both visits, I deprived myself of the joy of seeing the refulgency of the stained glass windows lit up by the sun. I can only imagine how gorgeous a dining experience that would have been; light streaming down from backlit iconography onto my food. As it was, I was tantalized by a hint of the possible glory: a rogue streetlight illuminated the face on one of the stained glass windows, perhaps staring at me disapprovingly for drinking in a former house of worship.\n\nAs it was, I felt the restaurant was a bit dark. Perhaps the owners could consider installing lights to light the stained glass windows from the outside during the nighttime? Indirect lighting to illuminate the ceiling, especially of the chancel where the brew tanks now sit would give an awe-inspiring sense of vastness to the room. Right now it just seems rather gloomy during the night.\n\nAdtmosphere / Space: An easy five stars out of five. Completely unique surroundings treated respectfully by the renovation. A word of warning: This is not the restaurant to take someone for a quiet, romantic date. This space revels in boisterous celebration and group fun.\n\nAs impressive as the space is, we're here to talk about the food, aren't we? Any divine inspiration therein? Deliverance from insipid cuisine? Read on.\n\nI enjoyed two brews at Church Brew Works, polar opposites of one another, and both superb. The Celestial Gold is a very light, hoppy beer. Here in Texas we would refer to it as a 'lawnmower beer'. Effervescent and light on the palette, but with just enough sting from the hops to let you know something is there. Very nice.\n\nThe Pepper Porter celebrates the darker forces in the universe. IT is heavy and brooding; decadently smooth with next to no aftertaste, and has very little carbonation, just an ever-so-slight caress of bubbles on the tongue. This porter has replaced Samuel Smith's as my favorite. \n\nOf the limited selections of beer I tried, I felt very happy with them both, and they are in the upper echelon of microbrews I've tried. This is a solid Three-point-seven-five out of Five, but let's round it up to four. If I hadn't been to Portland and immersed myself in the country's finest beer culture, it would have been higher.\n\nWow I've almost used up my 5000 characters already. Please petition Yelp to allow more.\n\nPirogi: Excellent, just like great grandmom used to make.\nPizza: Chicken and Chorizo. Good but not great.\nIce Cream: WONDERFUL malted vanilla with Cinnamon sauce. Some of the best I've had!\nBuffalo Ribeye: VERY good. The sauteed mushrooms were a highlight.\n\nOverall: I wanted to like the food more than I did. The owners clearly had faith in their space and their beer to bring in the customers, but as we all know, faith without works is dead. A disappointing but still solid three stars out of five.

You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!\n\nIf you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]\n\nFor two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.  \n\nOur brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.

Atmosphere-check.\n\nThe food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right. \n\nAside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting. \n\nService is really good here.

My sister and her boyfriend had taken my folks a while back and we had heard about this old Catholic church that had been converted into a brew pub and restaurant. So a day at the amusement park required a good, cold beer to close things out. \n\nNow the idea of drinking in a church seems somewhat sacrilegious to one who grew up evangelical Methodist. In my home church, you don't drink - or at least you don't admit to fellow parishioners that you enjoy what Ben Franklin called the \"nectar of the Gods.\" So to walk into a holy cathedral to get our drink on was weird, but I was so glad we went.\n\nThe church is huge. This place must give \"overhead\" a run for its money. It's a beautifully maintained church, with much of the decor intact. Pews for bench seating, the altar rail, lights, Windows, no crucifixes, Marys or Saints, thank God - perhaps that would be too much. \n\nThe menu was a little foodsy-artsy, but not too expensive (for foodsy-artsy) and it was tasty. I had a turkey & brie sandwich that made me very happy.  I am not a beer connoisseur, so I can't really judge the beer, but I liked mine, Ian liked his, and my sister and Brad (Brad brews his own  award-winning beer) liked theirs, so I'd say that's great.\n\nWhy not five stars?

Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee.

After Church Brew Works, one might say I was born again.\n\nI was in Pittsburgh for the first time this past week, attending a conference for work. The conference, while worth the travel in and of itself, more importantly provides an excellent chance to reconnect with colleagues from around the country. Thus, I was looking forward to the unstructured time in evenings, and choosing the gathering place for such periods is a delicate art. I ended up spending two nights at Church Brew Works, and it's not as though there was a lack of options. This place is special.\n\nThe first night, I went to CBW after dinner. Upon arrival, I ordered the sampler to split with a friend, to get our bearings and at least have a taste of the four mainstays and the four seasonals. The sampler was priced right at around $14 for eight five-ounce glasses. While I was less excited by some brews (like the Celebration), I was amazed by the complexity of both the Rotating Stout and the Four-Grain Harvest Ale. I drank Harvest Ales until they kicked us out that night.\n\nThe second night, we headed back to CBW for dinner. This night, I drank Rotating Stout exclusively. Very crisp for a stout, with an awesome smokey finish. I ordered the salmon entree for dinner. For $19, I figured it had to be good. Plus, the drafts were very reasonably priced, so I didn't mind spending a bit more on food. The salmon truly exceeded my expectations. It was perfectly cooked with minimal seasoning and placed atop a refreshing quinoa salad with cucumber. Sauteed oyster mushrooms accompanied the fish, which were delicious. The plate was ringed with a tasty soy reduction to provide salt, which complemented all the items perfectly. I could see how the soy might have been a bit strong for someone else, but I think it brought an appropriate kick to the dish.\n\nI continued to drink the Rotating Stout all night while we discussed the eventual collapse of civil society. Perfect conversation against the backdrop of an altar filled with heavy brewing equipment. There is something post-apocalyptic yet fantastically optimistic about CBW. Perhaps it's the not-so-subtle notion that our reverie should not be focused on a deity hovering in the heavens or a member of the clergy thumping on the pulpit, but rather, toward one another, in a place where the provisions nourish the soul and the communion is about building community.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-14", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Mike", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "BJYcB4Dy6wFMbwt3ALwhCQ", "review_id": "EF-WcslGjDBgIXlk3u6a3Q", "text": "What could be better than drinking beer in a place that used to be a church?

I did try their wine and I was pleased with bottle pricing and taste so if you are just looking to make a pit stop for a drink consider this a 3 star review. If youa re looking to eat pass this place up. A couple of basic issues first there is little to no parking neighborhood or in the lot in the back if you are going on a weekend night so plan ahead. This is ok I can deal with it if I love the place, second I was supposed to be seated with a large group but my friend and I would have been split up due to the pew seating. This was ok it was our fault for being late. We chose to sit in the bar instead of wait for our own table. So we get in the bar and service at a table was super slow we get our wine within 10-20 minutes of sitting which is fine but I think the food took 55 minutes for two sandwiches. The food was just bleh not high on taste after that wait and the hype I have heard I was hoping for more. But it is just another chain resaurant hiding inside a church (let down). I got the philly cheesesteak sandwich my friend the crab cake because we were hoping for something quick and filling. Cheese steak was just ok bun was too big and lack of  generic cheese sauce made it dry, no sauteed onions or peppers ( again let down.) My friend had the crabcake sandwich and they had not put any sauce on it. The waitress did bring her a tiny bit of sauce as it was supposed to come with sauce. Here is the kicker the sweet potato fries we both paid  $2.00 extra on top of our 15$ sandwiches for are from Sam's club! Hahahaha I have to laugh because if you're going to serve me precooked fries which I am sure a lot of places do don't charge me extra and at least try to make sure they are wedges or something. Throw a cajun spice rub on but don't barely heat them they were super cold.... and buy them at Sam's club. If you're one of hte most hyped breweries in pgh! People notice these things lol. At least it provided me with a good laugh. So all in all 4 stars for atmosphere yea its a cool place young attractive crowd, but I am a food lover 1-2 stars for food, 3 stars for drinks.

Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.\n\nSince I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75.

After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza.

There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.\n\nRegarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar.

One star because the beer I had - their \"black\" holiday brew - was very good, spicy and just the way I like it, and furthermore they had it available AFTER Christmas at a time when many brewpubs (if they bother to be open) will tell you they sold out of their Christmas beers before the holiday even arrived.  This place is also nice and big, probably about three times the size of many other brewpubs we've hit up, so there was no wait for a table for early dinner.   They do ask whether you want to be on the \"bar side\" or the \"restaurant side\"  (the sides are divided by what used to be the main center aisle of the church) without telling you the difference between the two, so I still don't really know what it is except the bar side has a bar and a TV.  Other than that they look alike.\n\nFood choices were rather more meh than I was hoping for, though.  This place specializes in pierogis.  I don't know when pierogis got all trendy, but I grew up in Cleveland, they have been around for decades, and I don't get particularly excited by putting different fillings in them.  Apparently the Church does.  Whatever, I don't care.  They also serve pizza, sandwiches, burgers, nothing too interesting.  Given that I work near Philly, the last thing I want is a cheesesteak made in Pittsburgh.  I ended up ordering a big bowl of the beer cheese soup and wishing they had a more interesting menu.  \n\nOur waiter and the overall beer selection were the two weak points of this place.  It only has about 10 beers on the menu.  I was pleasantly excited and surprised when the waiter told me they had all the beers but one, as I'm more used to this and that being  \"out, sorry\" especially during busy holiday weeks.  I did find one good beer to drink, but I tend to like beer samplers with a few small glasses of different beers,  or at least buying one glass each of two different beers per visit.  I didn't see anything on the menu in the line of a sampler; it may be I missed it, or perhaps it wasn't being offered when we were there, but since I see someone below mentioning one, I'm kind of wondering why I didn't see it and why our waiter didn't mention it.  Furthermore, when I tried to order a second beer that was not too hoppy and not a stout, I found that of the three (3) choices I had in mind, all were available only in large size bottles, i.e. not available by the glass but only in a large size meant for people to share.  The large sizes were too much for just me to drink given that I'd already had a pint.  I'm looking over to a bar stretching most of the length of a large church and wonder what is the problem that it can't have more taps flowing and more beers to select from by the glass rather than by the huge bottle?  Very much a bummer.\n\nAlso, after the guy brought initial beers and took our order  - a meal that included a small cup of soup for my companion, and just a large bowl of soup for me - Mr. Waiter didn't think to ask me if I wanted my soup now or wait till the \"entree\" (i.e. my companion's burger) was brought out.  I generally need to eat something with my beer (that I already had), and I was hungry.  The guy brought the little cup of soup to my dinner partner, brought me nothing, and then disappeared for like 20 minutes or more leaving me with nothing to eat but a couple slices of bread from the basket.  I couldn't get his attention to bring my soup because he literally did NOT emerge into view for that whole time!  The restaurant wasn't anywhere near full or busy and there seemed to be several wait staff around so I don't know what the deal was.  There was also some weird manager type in shirt and tie standing in the aisle giving the wait staff dirty looks the whole time we were there.  \n\nSummary:  Atmosphere and decor A, beer quality A,  beer selection B- , food selection B, waiter C- .   I'd go again, but next time I'll sit on the bar side and see if it's any better over there.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-01-06", "type": "review"}, {"username": "david", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "aTNP0Tt1TCE8ZcdUhve6_g", "review_id": "Ilw2VOkVhgD78p_T1adUTg", "text": "Ambience was amazing.

As a person who grew up in a Catholic church what's not to love?  I practically worship beer, so beer being on center stage on the altar conjures up something special when I walk through those heavy wooden doors.  I almost wish they put beer in the white marble holy water fonts to make the sign of the cross as you enter.\nNow for my latest experience as it's been probably three years since I have attended church due to travels and living abroad.  \nMy parents were in town and my dad loves everything about the beer making process, especially the consumption part.  It was also my wife's birthday and she too loves good beer, so to the Church we went.\nEveryone minus me hadn't been there before, so there was a bit of awe factor for the noobs.  Though we were all a bit disappointed with generic wreath hanging on the plexi-glass barrier guarding the altar.  I don't remember this barrier in my prior visits, a small negative, but a negative none-the-less.  \nWe were seated in a heavy traffic area at a small table, which we requested later to be moved to more cozy location.  This request was met graciously and as a former server I understand you have to try to seat someone in those places....\nWe all ordered our beers and my father requested the Sour Piet.  Much to his dismay they returned with our beers and three samples glass of beers that were not Sour Piet.  He was informed that had kicked the keg earlier, but hadn't known.  He tasted the other beers and decided to get the Thunderhop (my favorite).  We only had Thunderhops and Cherry Saisons.  Both were very good, as per usual.  Disappointing that they had run out of the Sour, and a little miffed that our server was not privy to it being gone, but again just a little negative.\nWe ordered two large pizzas -- The Cinco Formaggio and the Wild Boar BBQ.  Both were cooked perfectly in their amazing brick oven.  The pizzas were a bit too salty for our standards and they seemed to skimp on some of the ingredients so the balance was lost a little.  The Wild Boar was very good, but it lacked something, maybe spice or tang.  I think there was only a few slivers of the red onions on it....Again a small disappointment. \nAfter polishing off the majority of our pizzas my dad asked our server to fill up a 64oz growler with the Cherry Saison.  The server acted like this would be near impossible since it was a seasonal and limited brew, but said he'd try.  He returned triumphantly and bragged about how he'd done us a favor since they were out of Sour Piet.  An obvious ploy to get a little added to his tip, but again a small disappointment.\nI hope you caught on to the trend of a lot of little disappointments added up to make it a good experience, but not great.  I usually go after work for beers and pizzas with friends, for this it never disappoints.  But for a special occasion with family that has higher standard it left a little to be desired. \n Our experience was 3 stars, but because of all my fond memories I gave it 4.

It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.\n\nWell, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.\n\nSpeaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.\n\nI wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.\n\nAnd I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.\n\nOk, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. \n\nOn the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. \n\nThen came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.\n\nBut once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.\n\nI can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-21", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Kay", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg", "review_id": "2xPtZHSi7t0djA-62Sy9wQ", "text": "Darren took me here before I joined Yelp, and I liked it as much then as I did the other night. \n\nThe Coconut Stout beer was scrumptious. \n\nOur server Megan was all-around awesome. \n\nI loved the Wild Boar Quesadillas and the Belgian Fries with that superyummy lemon-caper aioli.\n\nMy Chicken Madrid was excellent.

The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.\n\nThere was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.\n\nWhen you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.\n\nAfter looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.\n\nThe service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.\n\nEverything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.\n\nI, however, cannot speak of the brews.

I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of \"this merits further investigation\") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this.\n\nI'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved.\n\nMost places you go, you don't expect this to happen.

As such, I was excited to order pierogis as my first dish in this city.  So what exactly did I get.  Hmmm.  I saw four pillow-like objects that looked like Chinese dumplings, but a little larger.  They sat in a pool of butter, and topped with a big ass dollop of sour cream.  Hmm, ok....so now to find out what juiciness awaits on the inside.  Mashed potatos?  Wait a second...what the hell is this? A blob of fat laying on top of carbs stuffed with more carbs, all swimming in a pool of fat?  My attention was then redirected to my friend who had just ordered the pierogi pizza.  Using my imagination, I visualized a thick crust pie with chunks of dough and mashed potatoes as toppings.  I was almost correct.  It was essentially a mashed potato pizza.  Now this concept is great if executed properly.  In fact, a pizza joint in New Haven, CT called Bar pretty much perfected this (Bacon, mashed potato thin crust pizza).  However, the pierogi pizza fell flat.  Just carbs on more carbs.    I also ordered what I thought would be a turkey breast sandwich.  I received grocery store deli turkey meat (the slimy processed kind that swims in sodium nitrite preservative inside a plastic container) in between two dry pieces of bread.  And this sandwich costs $9-10?  Where's the actual real turkey breast I thought I paid for?  Needless to say, the food was a big disappointment.  \n\nThe only thing that I can say positive things about is the beer.  Great beer selection.

I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.\n\n- The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of \"I do not want to be here.\" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.\n\n- The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.\n\n- I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.\n\nSo luckily, I was in good company because the experience here would've been absolutely miserable.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-16", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Lynn", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "tIsOdZrmCGq_4kLfqz68kA", "review_id": "4DZGuC8dmxfpdnSGLtuvmQ", "text": "We have been going to Church Brew Works, probably since they opened off and on for years.

Talk about re-purposing an old, unused building! Let this be an example to all cities with churches (and buildings of any type) that are sitting unused and/or derelict. This restaurant gives \"re-purpose\" a whole new meaning. \n\nOnly downside with re-purposing a building like this is the acoustics. Because the walls and ceiling don't have any shock absorbancy, sound is not absorbed and it gets *very* loud in here! We came here late at night, 9pm on a Friday. It was packed and loud. The way tables and booths are laid out gives every party privacy without putting up huge dividers. It's reminiscent of being in a mess hall or what I think of a dining area to be like in Henry VIII's court back in the Middle Ages. Just an openness you don't get in most dining experiences. \n\nThe church has pews, stained glass and a pulpit area, which has also been re-purposed into a brewing station, which may or may not be considered blasphemous! \n\nThe food was very good, though a little on the stodgy side. I made the mistake of eating some of a pierogi appetizer that my companions ordered, forgetting that I had ordered the special that night which was cheese and potato pierogis. Way too heavy; I would have been better off eating a salad. I also tried some of the spinach and cheese dip, which was incredible!!!\n\nOf course, the main attraction is the beer.

My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, \"Our kitchen is about to close.\" Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. \n\nThe appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.\n\nWhile we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.\n\nAgain, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.\n\nThen we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to speak to the manager. Miraculously, the kitchen was not actually closed. We had dessert - my Malted Bread Pudding was good, but my husband's Carrot Cake was way too gingery.\n\nThrough each course, the staff was cleaning around us, making us feel even more rushed, and we couldn't even have a normal conversation because they were hovering so much. Our server was acting like she couldn't wait for us to leave.\n\nWhen we were finished and it was time to pay, the manager finally came out. He glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints. By that time we felt so unwelcomed, we just wanted to get out of there. So, we were actually driving home when the clock struck midnight. So disappointing!\n\nI don't know how this place would be on a regular night, but I definitely would stay away from it on any sort of special occasion.

The food itself was sad and frustrating - especially considering the price of some dishes.\n\nAs I looked over the menu, I noticed one consistency: most dishes sounded very ordinary or even boring except for one or two incongruous ingredients. It is as if they are trying to make everything different or special by adding an arbitrary distinction.\n\nMy dinner started with the Seven Onion soup. Arbitrary Distinction #1. Are onions really so varied in flavor once cooked in broth and cheese that using seven varieties will create a nuanced dish? Well, it was decent but no different than French Onion soup anywhere else, made with six fewer onions no doubt.\n\nAfter the dinner menu failed to pique my appetite, I ordered the Turkey and Swiss sandwich from the pub menu. It arrived on pumpernickel slices, plain and untoasted like an elementary school lunch. This brown bagger of a sandwich consisted of dry turkey crumbles paired with greens and red onion but no moisture. The occasional taste of cranberry? Arbitrary distinction #2. I found myself painting it in ranch dressing and sucking down water just to be able to swallow without choking.\n\nOne table mate ordered the mussels dish. I noticed him rubbing the white sauce from the meat onto the garlic bread and I soon realized why. After biting into the bread with the sauce, I found myself being force to spit it into a napkin. The white sauce was so salty, bus loads of Jewish tourists could float on the surface of it. The bread was harshly peppered. They were inedible.\n\nAnother table mate's dish included a lemon aioli (#3) that was runny and astringent, as if flavored with Pledge Multisurface. Another had the southwesty wrap (I forget the name) and only ate the insides. The reason was a tortilla that was spicy enough to choke a person (#4). Want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup (#5)? I'll pass.\n\nI'm glad that the service was attentive because my palate needed those four water refills. Some advice, Brew Works? Pick a dish one at a time and refine it. Make it delicious. Your food doesn't need novelty condiments and bizarre pairings to be unique and memorable.

We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.\n\nWe waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  \n\nWhen the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)\n \nAfter the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. \n\nThe pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.\n\nNo surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).\n\nFINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.\n\nI wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.

The venue is breathtaking; it's worth it to come here just to enjoy the space and the stain glass windows. Definite plus that this old church was saved from demolition. I didn't order any food, but based on those around me it appeared that the prices might be a little high for what they offered. I had a stout, which was pretty good, and my partner had the doppelbock, which we agreed was just okay. There were no prices for the drinks on the menu (which drives me crazy) and the chalkboard menus behind the bar were too high to fully read. I think if we could have seen the IBUs on the menu for the doppelbock then it wouldn't have been our first choice, since we are not hopheads. They don't have many of their beers available in bottles or cans, so we settled on their Celestial Gold as a gift/souvenier for my parents. \n\nI'm definitely glad that I visited this place, and I think that it's worth the time if you're in the area.

Nice move! Restaurants should take note that this is the correct practice for \"service recovery\". Unfortunately, they botched their second chance.\n\nThe manager recognized us, even though we didn't mention we were there for service recovery.

That's the exact same thing that was the problem last time!

That is the one thing they should have had figured out this time. Also, it's not like we're particularly slow eaters or anything.\n\nThey don't seem to understand: the food is going to die on the table just the same as it will die on the pass. The point of coursing a meal is so that we get the entrees at the right temperature when we're ready to eat them. If you don't want the entrees to die, don't fire them so soon.

And frankly, so was I! Apparently, they no longer allow churches to be sold with their interior decor so this place is truly one of a kind!\n\nFirst off, this place is huge so you don't have to shy away from bringing large groups. They have a small lot behind the church so do consider carpooling. You are literally walking into a church and then walk into a large brewery instead. It is really fun! There is an earthy smell to the place that I liked (kinda like beets!) You can also see some of the cook stations like the pizza and oven dishes right up by the altar!\n\nI tried their celestial gold beer and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy lighter beers.\n\nNow to the food. I am not a German food eater and I was new to the cuisine sans dessert so be warned. I have been told German food is an acquired taste and can go wrong if you are not familiar with it. We started off with the perogies and I loved them! So soft and tasty. When we asked for an entree recommendation from our waitress, she said the buffalo pasta was one of her favorites. Loving the safety of chicken and pasta and buffalo sauce, I ordered it. The description said buffalo cream sauce with crumbled (blue/feta?) cheese on top. I am a sucker for creamy sauces. Well, I could not get through 4 bites of anything more than the pasta in this dish and I was trying really hard. The cream sauce appeared to be plain buffalo sauce that was congregating at the bottom of the paste discussing their very liquid form. The waitress was kind enough to exchange it for an appetizer of potato cakes and dessert. \n\nPotato cakes needed some seasoning. Their frozen peanut butter cake was perfect though.\n\nGranted, I stayed away from their traditional plates. However, my trainer had the braised pork chop with sauerkraut and that wasn't appetizing either. \n\nThe customer service experience here was great. Our waitress was attentive and we never had to waive her down for requests (this was before and after returning my dish by the way). The hostess was also super friendly and nice. The manager also came over to apologize. I really hate when I catch a managers attention since I am not at the restaurant to make a scene so it was nice for him to come by but definitely not necessary so kudos to their crew for that.\n\nIf you come here, expect great beer and a good time.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2014-09-16", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Gabrielle", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "n_-3jf0EXRQEDIAMAh1GhA", "review_id": "elKFTPw19GyLI_GgrfFePg", "text": "First timer at The Church Brew Works, and I was disappointed to say the least.\n\nTo begin, the building is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! But for some reason, they felt the need to hang tacky, poorly designed flags everywhere which so cheapened the ambiance.\n\nWe ordered 3 different types of beer: the Octoberfest, the Oatmeal Stout, and the Brett Ambrosia. The beer menu is confusing and not helpful. The seasonal beers were not described at all, and some of the normal beers had \"if available\" after them. - note that I got the Octoberfest after being told their trippel was not on tap, and my dad chose the oatmeal stout after being told that they were out of the seasonal coconut bourbon stout. You are a brewery, & this is not okay in my book.\n\nThe beer was not terrible, but not fantastic. Nothing I would ever order again. The stout was not complex or full bodied at all. The Octoberfest was also fairly bland and forgettable, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of bretts, but you might like it if you are.\n\nThe service was terrible. The waitress seemed clueless and awkward. She answered with an \"I don't know,\" more than once with no offer to try to answer questions, had no idea items were unavailable until after we had ordered them, and was incredibly unprofessional. If she was new, I could've looked past this, but she made no mention of being a new hire.\n\nFinalllyyy... The menus and food. The menus are awful. Very poorly designed and so confusing. The pages are falling out and the books are tattered. As far as I'm concerned, if you're charging $20+ for entrees like pasta, this is unacceptable. The choices on the menu had no rhyme or reason. Half were Italian and half were German, with a sprinkle of whatever else. \nThe food was mediocre. We only got a few small things because it didn't seem worth the money, and the service had us wanting to run out the door. The spinach smoked Gouda dip was okay, but nothing incredibly memorable. The German potato salad was decent, and the soup was alright. Prices were way too high, in my opinion, for what they were serving, especially when they seemed to not be able to get much else right.\n\nOverall, I was sad when leaving. This is such an incredible location with an amazing ambiance, but they killed it for me. Bad service, mediocre beer, and overpriced food made me not care if I ever came back.

I figured the chances of me catching fire in a deconsecrated church were much lower than in a regular church, and there was beer. Check and check.\n\nOverall?  Novel, but overrated.  Everything from the exterior of the building and the faux-billboard sign to the bar and brewing equipment in altar/sanctuary area inside the church is a bit of a head trip to see and experience, but once you get past the novelty of it all, the food and beer itself is pretty average.  A colleague I was visiting in Pittsburgh put it best by saying 'it's a place you only visit once, usually with friends from out of town'.  \n\nA group of colleagues and I visited Church Brew Works on a Wednesday at 7pm, and the beer wasn't the only thing that was hopping here (it was pretty busy).  We were seated immediately (reservation), however it took us about 20+ minutes to get the first round of drinks after we ordered them.  I don't know what took so long - perhaps he had to climb all the way up to the belfry to fetch them? Regardless, instant strike one. They have about 15 beers to choose from - 25% seasonal and 75% fixed) and you can also order sampler flights of up to 8 beers. I sampled 4 or 5, and really didn't find any of them to be very impressive.  The rotating coffee stout I ordered was pretty boring, although I did enjoy the pale ale.  Unfortunately it took me another 20 minutes to get it after ordering.  Seriously, what's the deal with a brew pub not being on top of drink orders?  Strike two.  I will say that despite the delay, our server was very friendly and helpful.  \n\nWe ordered food, and I got the bison corn dogs (yum!) and the boar jambalaya (meh).  I've never eaten either meat, and I was happy for the opportunity.  The corn dogs were breaded and cooked perfectly, and came with honey mustard and ketchup condiments.  The jambalaya was not very impressive.  Actually, it was boring. It was more of a rice dish than an actual jambalaya, which was disappointing. My friend really liked the pierogies, and all of the desserts were well-received.  I liked the bread pudding that I sampled off of someone else's plate. \n\nThe server split the check 10 ways for us without asking, so that was a nice plus. I found some of the dishes to be a bit overpriced for what they were, but perhaps you're also paying for the novelty of it all? (and maybe the heating bill for a church in late November).\n\nI recommend visiting this place for the novelty, but a place with 'Brew Works' in the name needs to have better beer for me to give it a better review.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-11-20", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Cait", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "N1Fh7ob5lQzIiCkiAtxArQ", "review_id": "SNuuTs_uICnNeoVCDTwszA", "text": "A completely different experience than a few years ago!

The Scallops were raw and wound up eat the outside edge of two and took home to cook, only cooked on one side.

I'll be using that word a lot in this review. If they would just pick a direction when it comes to the food, it would be so much more enjoyable to come here. As they are now, I was very unimpressed. \n\nI would come here just to drink however, because their beer was actually pretty great. I tried a pale ale that I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, and the Pious Monk Dunkel, which was my favorite of the 2. It's a darker beer, but not too bitter and doesn't have a strong hoppy taste. It was like, my perfect beer. I also had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and it was very nice. They also make a mean dessert martini. Don't worry, I didn't order all of this stuff for myself. I just surround myself with lightweights and then finish their drinks. ;) \n\nThe food however, was so uninspiring to me. They had multiple menus: a winter menu, a dinner menu, and a pub menu that has a lot of the same things the dinner menu does, plus sandwiches and pizza. I had a Kobe beef cheese steak off the pub menu, and it was good, but it tasted just like any other cheese steak I've ever had. My mom got soup and salad that she wasn't super impressed with, and my dad got a shrimp etouffee that was shockingly out of this world. I had one bite, and it was 2009 and I was on a balcony in New Orleans again. It certainly packed a punch.\n\nNothing I had was bad, but I literally needed half an hour with the menus just to find something that sounded somewhat appealing. If you're a brewery restaurant, why don't you just have ONE menu full of food that would taste good with a beer? Instead, everything seemed overly complex, disjointed, and just plain unappetizing. Nothing I saw sounded good. I can't even remember the last time that's happened to me at a restaurant. I hope I'm not out of line in saying any of this, I may have just been having a bad night and I have been watching a lot of Kitchen Nightmares episodes lately so maybe I'm being a snob. I was just so completely disappointed with the food choices given to me, and if I were asked to describe the type of cuisine served here, I would have no idea what to tell you. They've got pierogies, but nothing else Polish, they've got Etouffee, but nothing else Creole, they've got mussels and a salmon dish, but it's not a seafood restaurant. They've got a pub menu, but not pub food. It was just frustrating. I don't think I'll go back here to eat unless they rework their menu. I would come back for the beer however.\n\nI forgot to mention service though, and it was fantastic. John was friendly, funny, enthusiastic, prompt, and knowledgeable about the beer. He was able to recommend based on our tastes, and his choices were spot on. Great server. \n\nThe building itself is really cool, the beer was great, but the menu was just a hot mess, in my humble opinion.

We finally had a night to go out and do something so I thought it would be nice to go eat somewhere different. \n\nThe beer here was very nice. I ordered the Celestial Gold. I'm not a huge fan of dark beer so I thought this would be a great option and i really enjoyed it! Bobby ordered the Polaris Patersbier which is explained in their menu blonde belgian beer with minty/hop aromas and a herbal/pine finish with a little bitterness.. woah that explained it perfectly. How do they do that? I stuck with the same beer and next he tried Pious Monk Dunkel . It wasn't his favorite so he ended with the patersbier :) i noticed a few people ordering the beer sampler (as well as pictures of it on yelp) I did not see this advertised in the menu and totally forgot about it. Maybe next time :( (Where was this located in their beer menu?!)\n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the traditional perogies. The onions were perfect! I could have had them as a side dish. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and upgraded to sweet potato fries.  To be honest, the fries were not hot at all which was a real bummer because i LOVE sweet potato fries. Everywhere i've went, the restaurant served the fries with a honey cinnamon dip. CBW served with a chipotle ketchup. Dont get me wrong, it was a nice twist on ketchup, but it did not go with sweet potato fries at all. Seriously. Who thought sweet potato fries and spicy ketchup went together? \n\nBobby ordered the shrimp & grits.... DELICIOUS. I was skeptic because It seems like a light brunch affair, not dinner but it was very filling and was made perfectly. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the frozen peanut butter mouse cake. It was okay.. nothing too special.\n\nI found service to be average. The GM was walking around so happy and peppy asking tables about their meal. Also, when walking to the restroom all of the other servers seemed happy and great with their tables. Our server Ashley put no enthusiasm into the night and kind of seemed annoyed when we asked about the different beers. Also, our dirty appetizer plate sat on our table the entire meal even though i put it right on the end and Ashley stopped at our table a few times. It was a little awkward especially because i used to serve and a big tip is to clear the table when you see dirty plates. Whatever.. \n\nService, my crappy sweet potato fries & the mediocre dessert are stopping me from the 4 star review.\n\nWe enjoyed the beer though and atmosphere.  im sure we will be back soon.", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2015-04-02", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Laura", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q", "review_id": "dH0ZJpPzu9FjINS0uoPiUg", "text": "Despite the disaster that was my break up with my ex last summer, I still keep coming back to the place we first met in person- CBW! I ridiculously love their Thunderhop IPA and it is always my go-to beer if none of the seasonal varieties peak my interest. I'm not a fan of the Celestial Gold but my (new-er) bf, who is not much of a beer drinker and prefers wine or mixed drinks, enjoyed it and said it's \"perfect for non-beer drinkers\". Since I last reviewed any of the menu options, I have sampled a lot, hence the need for an update! \nAs far as apps go, the Spinach, feta, and smoked gouda dip is  great for sharing and has that oozy, cheesy \"comfort\" taste to it. This is always a winner in my book, particularly because gouda and feta are my two favorite types of cheeses. The chips are, well, just chips. Maybe warmed pita bread would be a tastier substitution to the chips in the future. The bruschetta is also a solid appetizer to share. The ratio of toppings to bread (which usually annoys me when ordering bruschetta because I constantly feel like I'm left with either a lot of topping and no crostinis or the exact opposite) is perfect!\n In addition to the wild boar BBQ pizza (which will always be my favorite pie at CBW), I've also had the pleasure of enjoying the Artichoke, spinach, and feta pizza and the chicken and sundried tomato pizza. Both were very flavorful and served pipping hot right out of the oven. The ingredients were very fresh and evenly distributed throughout the pie. The sundried tomato pizza I enjoyed actually was \"on the house\" because the bartender (such a quirky guy but well-meaning) clearly forgot to ring in the order (the big clue was when it had been 25 minutes and he asked what we had ordered again). Being the pizzas here are a bit on the pricey end, I greatly appreciated this generosity particularly considering the inconvenience as well. \nI've also had the opportunity to sample some of their sandwiches, and I was pretty impressed with those as well! I've tried the Buffalo burger, the chicken and brie sandwich, and the pulled pork sandwich. The buffalo burger, cooked to a perfect MR, was so flavorful in it's natural juices that I did not use any condiments or have any add ons (like bacon or sauteed mushrooms or onions-perhaps next time since all of a sudden that sounds amazingly delicious!) With the chicken and brie sandwich, I loved how the brie complimented the granny smith apple slices on the sandwich! It was cheesy yet not overly so-very delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty too-particularly the BBQ sauce which I believe to be the same used on the Wild boar BBQ pizza!\nAnd just a general statement on the atmosphere-pretty freakin' awesome!

As the name suggests, this brewery is located in a former St. John the Baptist Church.  You would never know from the front that it was a brewery.  In fact, when I approached I was convinced that the smaller building next to it was the brewery and the large 8,000 square foot building was an actual operating church.  I was totally wrong.  The entire church is the brewery.  As you walk inside there are pamphlets like those you might find in a church, but these tell all about the brewery.  The inside is set up as a church too!  The tables are set up where the aisles would be.  There is a church organ in the back and beautiful stained glass windows along the side of the structure.  In the front, in place of the pulpit are the huge brew tanks.  To continue church theme, they have beers such as Celestial Gold, Pipe Organ Pale Ale and Pious Monk Dunkel.  The building is really beautiful and one of the most remarkable backdrop for beer drinking.\n\nI sat at the bar and had a beer flight so that I could sample as many of their beers as possible.  On this particular day there were eight for me to enjoy.  My beer coaster had the motto \"On the eighth day man invented beer\".  I appreciate when a proper beer establishment like this one also posts a giant board with the name of each beer as well as the ABV and IBU of each one.  The beers were all superb and had a nice twist on the norm.  The wit beer had all kinds of spices and the porter had a hint of coconut to separate them from the usual suspects you may find at other bars.  Church Brew Works sells growlers, bottles and even mini kegs.  They also provide a sweet stainless steel growler option.\n\nThe food was terrific too which is always enjoyable to pair with beer.  And it was not the typical greasy \"bar food\" fare, but actual \"restaurant\" food.  I had the opportunity to try my first ever pierogie and it was super.\n\nChurch Brew Works is easily in my top ten of overall worldwide breweries.\n\nMeet up as SFLHops to the next beer event at http://www.meetup.com/Craft-Beer-in-the-Tri-County-Beer-its-Good-for-You/", "business_id": "bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-05-28", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Eira", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "eYf4v7EL-1PY9g3WM_qknw", "review_id": "lxPLMp4e9NoPsuWMAYQazw", "text": "We came here on the recommendation of a friend.

I went back after a lackluster first experience (summed up by \"liked the beer, hated the food\"), I thought their menu looked great, and figured I'd try it again. To start, the service was awful. While FOUR hosts/servers chatted about their weekends, we waited about 10 minutes by the \"wait to be seated\" sign, until we finally flagged someone down. \"Oh, I thought someone already helped you\", they responded. Nope.\n\nWe met some friends for dinner, and ordered some beer. The waiter (a different individual from the four at the front) dropped his pen into my beer. And did not offer to replace it. I was not happy, but figured hey, it won't kill me...the beer was okay, not great. We'll blame it on the ink.\n\nWe ordered appetizers, bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball. Both were very tasty! Our friends ordered sangria (delicious), and cask ale (also very good).\n\n My husband got the shrimp and grits, which was smoky and creamy. I ordered a beet salad with roast chicken, and my friends got a cheese pizza we all shared. The chicken was RAW in the middle. I don't mean \"a little pink, could have been cooked more\" ... I mean could have still probably been revived by a skilled veterinarian. I sent it back. The waiter looked surprised and apologized. A manager came over and said \"the kitchen usually cooks the chicken all the way\"...well I hope so! He did not charge me for the raw chicken, though they did offer a replacement, which I declined.\n\nThankfully the pizza was good, so I didn't leave hungry.\n\nThey did not comp the beer, or offer anything other than a VERY halfhearted apology.

It is very obviously caused by the beer they brew there, but it reminds me of being in a barn. Not a barn with dirty animals, but an old barn with lots of old hay all over the ground. It's not CBW's fault that I can't handle that smell because that is a side effect of brewing beer within a restaurant, but I can't do it.  \n\nThe only other con for CBW is that I don't like some of their beer. Let me be clear, *some* of their beer is not for me, but I've had a few that I like, and if you're unsure you can always order samples. Every time I've been to CBW the staff has been great and they are more than willing to bring samples (and take pictures of you and your best friend who is visiting from out of town.)\n\nAll of the food I've eaten at CBW was good, but the desserts were really GREAT.

I mentioned CBW and since it's been about 3 years since we last visited, we decided to check it out. It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be. \n\nThe church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.\n\nMy boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi saut\u00e9 (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off. \n\nI was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like \"steak umms\". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal. \n\nOur waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful! \n\nOverall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.\n\nPS--if you sign up for their e-mail mailing list, you get a free CBW pint glass!

And Catholic guilt is appropriate for this venue as, obviously, \"Church\" Brew Works is located in a very old Catholic Church.  \n\nWhen you walk in if you're Catholic, by habit, you'll want to dip your hands into the Holy Water holder that is sans Holy Water.  But your eyes will immediately go to the old altar that now holds large vessels that are brewing and fermenting some pretty great beer.  That being said, be aware that you're going to smell some pretty strong malty-sweet aromas from the brewing.  On my most recent visit it was stronger than I would have preferred.  But no fear, we were able to sit outside, which is like transforming yourself into a scene from Harvard in the late 1800's.  The little courtyard patio outside is two levels surrounded by brick walls covered in ivy.  You can sit with a small group or bring all your friends and grab the picnic table with the long bench.  Either scenario is going to be great.\n\nOnto the food.  Oh how I love the menu here.  I always want to go for the wood fired pizzas because they rock - and there are so many culinary treats to choose from like pierogie pizza or chicken and pineapple or wild boar BBQ.  That's right, I said Wild Boar and I'm not lying.  Amazing thin crust wood fired to perfection.  \n\nThe menu typically has a salmon or some sort of fish but what you can always count on is a delicious pierogie option.  You're in Pittsburgh and Church Brew Works does their pierogies right.  On my most recent visit I had buffalo chicken pierogies and truth be told (we were in church so I cannot tell a lie) there wasn't a crumb left on my plate.  \n\nIf you have friends in town visiting Pittsburgh for the first time or the tenth impress them by taking them to Church Brew Works.

The restaurant is located in a former Catholic church and a large one at that. St. John the Baptist Church opened in 1907 in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Lawrenceville. But in 1993, with the consolidation of several Pittsburgh parishes, the church was closed and deconsecrated. The church building was purchased and repurposed as the Church Brew Works, opening in 1996. The renovation of the building retained many of its features, including the stained glass windows, a side chapel, the wooden floor, and the altar reredos. Tables and booths replaced the pews and brewery vats were placed in the altar area.\n\nEntering the restaurant continues to give the feel of entering a church. It is a very striking picture and the size of the enterprise is surprising. Does the food match its setting? I'd say it does. We arrived for lunch and were seated nearly in the middle of the former nave. First off was a appetizer of Untraditional Pierogies appetizer. This zesty turn on the Polish (and Pittsburgh) staple featured chicken and a salsa topping. I ordered a Buffalo Burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and Susan the Traditional Pittsburgh Style Salad. The salad included grilled chicken, but Susan asked for it without the traditional French fries mixed in. The Buffalo Burger (made with Buffalo meat) was great! Cooked to a nice Medium and very tasty and juicy.\n\nOn a second visit, we came for dinner. I ordered a House Salad to start and Pierogie Saut\u00e9 as a main. The Pierogie Saut\u00e9 came with five pierogies in a cream sauce tossed with with broccoli and tomatoes. It was delicious! Too, it was not as heavy a meal as one might imagine.\n\nThe restaurant also has pizza and other very interesting sounding main dishes on its menu.

I'd heard they'd gotten progressively less nice in comparison to the other wonderful dining options now available in the area, however Kyle loves their beer and I was curious to go and see if they'd stepped up there game at all. I can now say I think the Lawrenceville competition has been rather good for them. Things that bothered me on my last visit when compared to the numerous great experiences I'd had previously weren't issues any longer. \n\nThe service was great from start to finish, unlike the rather awkward experience I had there before taking a break. I'd always loved coming to the CBW with out of town friends or on special occasions for slightly less greasy pub food, and in that aspect I think some of their menu changes are working well! The new chicken options are delicious, and the pulled pork looks way better than what I ordered last time. I went with the Maui chicken sandwich on this visit, and the massive slice of grilled pineapple was a nice touch. There are also some vegan dishes that seem promising. \n\nFor drinks we got the beer sampler on this trip, and it was such a great deal. Only the Christmas ale was lacking in character. The other seven beers were wonderful. I don't think I'll get anything other than the sampler in future honestly. I do hope the CBW continues in this promising way.

However, each visit after I was less and less satisfied. First of all, it is a spectacle to see. The Church itself and stain glass decor is beautiful. The brewing equipment on display at the alter is in plain view and for anyone into brewing it is fun to look at. I mean, they turned a Church into a brewery!  If you are even remotely curious, I suggest you at least go for a drink and look around.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, that was my main draw as my love for craft beer put a big bullseye on this destination. The first visit I did a flight which had their standard 6 or 7 beers like Pious Monk and Thunder Hop along with a rotating tap or 2. I believe the flight had 8 decent size samples for $13 or so. Now that first visit was great and I took all of the beers in. After a few more visits I can say that only the Pious Monk and Thunder Hop are memorable.  The rotating tap is usually decent but the rest is not very good for my tastes. I enjoy IPAs and full body beers. These to me lack flavor and just come off as average domestics.  No complexity and watered down.  If I go back I will stick with what I know I like and see what the rotating tap is. You can get growlers to go for a very reasonable price which I've done before.\n\nOne nice summer day I was in and sat on the patio which is very nice and enclosed with flag decor. I ordered a Dark N' Stormy (dark rum and ginger beer over ice with lime) and I must say it is the best thing I have ever had at Church Brew Works!  And the best Dark N' Stormy I've had anywhere. I don't know what they do but they should keep doing it.\n\nThe food much like the seating is split into two distinct categories. Pub side and Dinner side. Pub is more traditional bar foods and is cheaper where Dinner is more upscale and a jump in price. I generally go for Pub side seating on the left (dinner to the right) along with that menu since it's usually a quick stop for drinks. I've had dinner as well but in my opinion it is all small portioned and very bland though the presentation looks very nice.  The last few times I've gone I have skipped food all together.  I should also mention that they have oven baked pizzas but again, small and bland. But they look nice.  I'm just not impressed by the food options verse price compared to other breweries I've been to.  \n\nThe service has always been top notch and friendly. The place is clean and huge so there is hardly ever a wait unless you have a big group. It is definitely somewhere you should check out for yourself and make a decision.

We were expecting to have a long wait, but as a pleasant surprise we were able to be seated right away. As I mentioned before, Church Brew Works is inside of an old renovated church, which is a very hip idea. If you look up towards the altar, you see all of the brewing equipment for the beer. I like that the owners made an attempt to preserve the original feel of the church while also renovating it to a point that it feels new and interesting. At the same time, I feel that the decor could be a little bit more extensive. The owners had a major opportunity to make this one of the coolest and trendiest restaurants around, but I didn't feel a wow factor when I walked in.\n\nWe decided to order a couple appetizers, as we weren't extremely hungry but were looking for more of a snack. I will say that the food is a step above the traditional pub food I was expecting. We ordered the pork tostadas, the gouda and artichoke dip, and the French fries. The tostadas were a little cold when they arrived, but the flavors were nice. They kind of had a zesty Mexican taste to them. The gouda and artichoke dip was probably my favorite app that we ordered, and I would get it again. I do wish the dip was bigger though, as we had a lot of chips left over at the end and no dip for them. The French fries were surprisingly pretty good, and they came with a roasted red pepper sauce on the side that we all enjoyed much more than ketchup.\n\nOverall, the food was better than I expected but also a bit pricey for simple small appetizers. I love the idea of the restaurant, but the execution was a little lacking for me. I don't think I would necessarily rush back to Church Brew Works anytime soon.

It is, by far, the best way to kill some time or have a delicious sit down meal. \n\nSince we weren't really interested in ordering a meal, we decided just to sit at the bar. Immediately after sitting down, the bar tender handed us drink menus. I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of beer. (Sorry beer fans!) So I instead tried on of their February specials: Forbidden Fruit. It was a mix of champagne and pomegranate juice. It was delicious. I also tried the sangria... Best sangria I've ever had in my life! My friends and I decided to order a beer sampler. \"When in Rome...\" Right?! Like I said, I'm not the biggest beer fan, but I'm optimistic about trying new things. The sampler came with 8 beer samples, and the bar tender explained every single one of them to us in detail. \n\nBy that point, we were all feeling a little hungry so we decided to order some small appetizers. I ordered the bruschetta. Very, very tasty bruschetta. Maybe they could have chopped the cherry tomatoes a little smaller, but that's my personal preference. We also ordered some pierogis.

I asked for a side of steamed broccoli, which the server offered to order on top of the Veggie Spaghetti dish as part of the gluten free substitution to avoid an additional charge.

I had fun because of the people that I was with but the food and service was just lacking.....\n\nWe had a group of 5 people that wanted to go out to dinner and hang out on a Saturday night. Fran, one of the friends, called the restaurant and asked if they took reservations. The lady said that they did not and it was first come first serve but gave no indication of how long that could be. She said, \"I am sure we can get you in soon.\" If you hear something like that you just assume that the wait is not that long. Well....we got there and the wait was an hour and a half or more. Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhtttt??? Why wouldn't you say that over the phone? Not impressed at all. But we decided to stay. The only good thing is that the left side of the Church Brew Works is no reservations. So, if you were wily enough you could just wait for a table to open up and hope you get there fast enough to grab it.\n\nGood news, I'm like a wily cat and grabbed a table, before they even cleared it, and we were seated 20 minutes or less after we got there. Big accomplishment! So we sat down and ordered some drinks and just looked over the menu. \n\nThat is when the server issue started. Our server was no where to be seen throughout the entire dinner experience. And even to get the check took forever. I did not see many servers and even saw two managers helping out so I just assumed they must have been short staffed.  But that and not being told that there was that long of a wait bumped them to two stars.\n\nFood:\nCup of French Onion Soup:\nThis was actually really good. This soup was really well made and was not salty at all. It had a great flavor to it. I really enjoyed the croutons and the melted cheese on the top. I wish there was a little more cheese and less of the croutons but overall it was well made.\n\nLettuce Wraps:\nDiced southwest rubbed chicken breast tossed in a soy ginger reduction. Served with julienne carrots and zucchini noodles in an Asian sweet and sour sauce, crushed peanuts, and bibb lettuce.\nUmm...the chicken was served cold. The chicken was not warm it was cold. That is not something that we were expecting at all. When I think lettuce wraps I usually have had the chicken hot/warm. Not these one they were served cold. The chicken was also in chunks and not ground. I am on the fence about that. While it was easier to handle not many people could share this dish because the were not many chunks. \n\nSide salad:\nThis side salad was huge. I was impressed with the portion size. The blue cheese dressing was also on point. I enjoyed this the most. \n\nPizza: Wild Boar BBQ\nSlow roasted pulled wild boar, Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese.\nThe pizza was so salty it was almost inedible to both Chris and I. AND it was $22. Nothing about this pizza was good. The pizza had too much sauce on it so it was floppy and each slice fell if you lifted it. The cheese over took the pizza and was choking. There was not a lot of the corn or red onions to counter act the taste of the bbq sauce that was not appetizing at all. And the boar was too salty as said before. I ate one slice, Chris ate one, and we ended up giving a $22 pizza away to someone who said they might want to eat it. Ugh... disappointing for sure. \n\nI know they are good!

Let's start with the place itself. The church was built in 1903 and is declared a historic site. Inside, most of the original decor of the church remains. The old church organ pipes remain in the balcony of this historic site and what I like most is the stained glass windows. By the way, most of these historic Catholic Windows site above huge steel drum vats of custom beer.  I haven't decided if this is sac-religious. . The old altar holds several vats of beer and the actual system that creates their brews.  It is amazing. I have pictures to share. \n\nNow, the beer!! I tried a coconut and strawberry brew. Now, this was not some sweet concoction and in fact it wasn't served with a normal tapper and keg system. It was a pump system that was served a little on the room temperature side and it was fantastic. This craft local brew was not sweet, it was dark but not heavy and had a nice nutty aroma to it. I'm no beer connoisseur, but I loved this experience and the fact that it was slightly warm made my beer tasting experience very enjoyable. \n\nThe food:\nWe ordered pizza. Now, you might be thinking, really??? Did I mention they have a wood fire oven!!!!??? \n\nYes, they do! And the big thing is this. The pizza is great!! Phenomenal. Unreal!! Out of bounds as Guy would say. Now, we created a cool concoction.  A pepperoni, green peppers, and lamb sausage pizza.  The green peppers were cut thin, which I enjoyed as it was not too much of the peppers and just the right amount. The lamb sausage was incredible. This was one amazing pizza!! Seriously!! You will not find a better pizza. My colleague at work never had pirogies. Really? Dude, you are kidding me? So, we ordered two apps, traditional and Pittsburgh-ized. The non-traditional had a horseradish based inside and were amazing!!\n\nNow, at this point you might be thinking, this review is pretty great, why just 4 stars? Well, dessert was awful!! We each ordered bread pudding which Had a bourbon sauce with it.  The bread was some crappy frozen concoction that was simply awful!! I didn't think the dessert justified dropping this place to a 3 star. I thought that was unfair. \n\nBread pudding is one of my top 2 desserts.  You have some flexibility with me when it comes to preparing it but this was clearly a crappy joke of a dessert.  \n\nPlease, please, please make your own from scratch. It isn't that hard and you can do so much better. \n\nYelpers, despite the dessert disaster, this place is an absolute must see and experience!!! Trust me!!

I usually visit a Danny's car wash or the like but didn't have a ton of time to wait around and wanted the hood cleaned off ASAP so not to damage the paint. I'd seen this place several times while waiting for the light on 7th Ave and Van Buren and was always a little skeptical of a $3 car wash and one that uses brushes. It was closest to me and cheap so I thought I would give it a go. \n\nYou can enter from Van Buren or Grand Ave. They do accept Credit/Debit cards and I noticed several spots for pre and post washing to further clean. I opted not to since I was in a hurry and hopeful that I wouldn't have to do anything pre-wash. I pulled up and someone gave me the low down on how things worked. He was very friendly with no upselling and I opted for the $5 wash thinking it might have a bit more 'oomph' to get the hood completely clean. Though there were probably 10 cars in line, the line went really fast and I made my way up to the attendant who helped direct my car onto the track. He handed me the towel to wipe down the console and away I went.\n\nLet me just say, before I moved to PHX, I used to wash my car at a self service place and hand wipe it down. I'm a bit OCD when it comes to a clean car. I even take the swiffer dusting pads with me to remove any lint that my rag leaves on the interior. When I moved out here, I quickly realized almost no one does this and no one wants to do it in 115 degree heat so I've been a full service customer for the last year. I hoped that this would be a cheaper option to the $15-20 trip to Danny's but the wash didn't quite hold up....\n\nIt was very unnerving at first just having the car move along the track but I didn't run into anything so that's good! There were several big brush rollers that went over the car and I passed through sets of rollers. I didn't smell anything like other's have mentioned though. The wipe they handed me was okay but it did leave a few lint particles on the dark surfaces. I thought for sure with all of those brushes I'd come out spic and span so I didn't even stop to wipe down anything and just headed home.\n\nWhen I got out, the wash probably got about 90% of the spots off the hood which is pretty acceptable but I still needed to clean it and get it off completely. I then noticed several bug leftovers on the backs of the side mirrors and it almost didn't touch the bugs on the bummer. I may go back if the car just has dirt and dust and opt for a full service place for bugs and harder to clean spots.", "business_id": "2yTFyn4Tv6gu63i5WMHjRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-07-22", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Honest", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "9bP3urjM__IP5csFh9ZsuQ", "review_id": "Ef-DPa2QnxhS_MNqus4tuA", "text": "The other issue is recently I've had problems with the automatic gate.

I was horrified since I have low profile wheels.  I noticed some gashes in my wheel prior to this date but was assured by the staff at Clean Freak that it was impossible for their wheel mechanism to cause this damage. \n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a possibility that I could have done it myself as it was a very small section (2-3 inches) and I didn't notice it right away. \n\nThis time, I noticed, and when I inspected my wheel there was at least 10-12 inches of vertical scraping and gashes embedded into my previously pristine wheel. I contacted the manager who wasn't on duty that evening and he assured me that there was no way it was their equipment. \n\nHe offered to do these things:\n\nRun the car through the wash to prove to me that it was fine. \nWatch the surveillance video.\nCome in so that he can see it and there is no way he can advise me if he hasn't seen it.\n\nI drove in immediately. He said based on the looks of it that there is no way it was the car wash and it was clearly curb rash... I brought up the fact that the direction of the scraping is not congruent with a forward movement, he still denied responsibility. I realized he wasn't going to take any so I offered for me to file a claim if he would pay my deductible which he refused flatly. \n\nUpon inspecting the entrance to the wash, there is a dual metal railing that is the exact height of my wheel, I asked him if it was possible for that to have caused the damage and he said, no way. He admitted that he would not assume any responsibility for the damages to my wheel; period. Unles the footage was done from every angle and clearly shows the area in the beginning of the railing, I didn't see how spending another waking second with this joke of a \"manager\" so I thanked him for his time, snapped some photos and asked to cancel my membership. He did so, but definitely didn't offer to refund me, so I will be billed for the month. \n\nI am pretty upset that now I have to file a claim with my insurance company and pay $500 out of my pocket to have my wheels replaced. \n\nUnless you have a crappy car, I would stay away from this place. If you have low profile wheels, DEFINITELY do not use this service unless you want your wheels mangled.\n\nDo not use #CleanFreakCarWash", "business_id": "2yTFyn4Tv6gu63i5WMHjRg", "stars": 1, "date": "2015-07-08", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Val", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "EzbuBR1l5IwWakjtcxnthA", "review_id": "6XIArRHu_NIkZ2jEzOa4VQ", "text": "The only reason they have one star is because I had to give them something and there were no minus stars to be left.\nClean Freak Car Wash denied damage to my car even after it was clear on video.

His gallery exhibits some of his famous pieces, that range from $4K to $40K+.  \n\nI saw a amazing wall sized 4 panel piece.  This piece was $25K just for the framing.  The price of the print depends on the picture.  Only 300 of each image is released.  When the image is new, the the price is roughly $4K.  As the images become sold out the price appreciates to $40K.  If you purchase a wall sized 4 panel picture, plus an almost sold out image, it would cost you $25K + 40K, roughly $65K.  The price of a car!  The framing is done with the same glass used on an airplane windsheild.  It is supposed to be bullet proof!!  A multi-purpose frame, does that justify the pricing? The framing can be used to dodge bullets and not just for a pretty piece of art.  The framing is also suppose to fight the effects of fading for a lifetime.\n\nThere are these cool side rooms in the gallery where you can change the lighting.  When the lighting is changed on these pictures, the images become almost 3D and alive.\n\nGreat gallery with amazing pieces of art!\n\nHAPPY PETER LIKING!!", "business_id": "LLGxO9ABWIxlkMQOYjiq_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Teri", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "0RrgEy-Yk1kWvAXEbOG5Nw", "review_id": "X3KfF3md-Ik9a5f_8GCbkw", "text": "Wandering around trying to find our way back to our hotel and I saw this gallery and squealed!

As I was with my sisters and their children, I thought it would be better to drive there.\n\nNo one even wanted to come here, but I told them they had to because it was really pretty and it would be nice for the kids to maybe ride the gondola. They obliged.\n\nAs we had a show to attend, we only had a few hours to spare at the Venetian. As soon as I walked in, the first thing that caught my eye was the Lik Gallery so I walked in. I had no idea who Peter Lik was and what he was about, but something about the photographs at the entrance of the gallery got me and pulled me in. I turned to my sisters and told them to come check out the stuff. After about a minute of browsing, Jason came over to me and struck up a conversation. Before I knew it, we were in a private room and he was explaining everything to us from who Peter was and what he was all about and how his photographs worked. We were all ooooooh and aaaaaaah and whaaaaaaaaaaat. As soon as he started dimming the lights and the photographs began to look different I was sold. \n\nOur plan that day was to walk around the Venetian, but we ended up spending three or so hours at the gallery. And it was such a pleasant experience. I say that because the kids (ages 7 to 15) didn't complain that they were bored. They sat there with us enjoying everything they saw.\n\nMy sisters ended up each buying a piece. We went in just to enjoy the gallery and walked out with all kinds of goodies.\n\nI just have to give a special shoutout to Jason. He was great. Not at all pushy and quite the opposite of a salesman. Typically, sales folks are pushy and a bit annoying. We've all been there. Not Jason. He was totally chill. \n\nMy sister in San Diego already received her purchase and is loving it. My sister in New Jersey should be getting hers pretty soon. She requested for it to be mailed at a different time. \n\nThank you Jason and the whole team for a great experience.", "business_id": "LLGxO9ABWIxlkMQOYjiq_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-08-07", "type": "review"}], "state": "NV", "longitude": -115.1696491, "stars": 5.0, "latitude": 36.1218632, "attributes": {"By Appointment Only": false, "Accepts Credit Cards": true, "Good for Kids": false, "Parking": {"garage": false, "street": false, "validated": false, "lot": false, "valet": false}, "Price Range": 4}, "type": "business", "categories": ["Arts & Entertainment", "Art Galleries", "Shopping"]}, {"city": "Montr\u00e9al", "review_count": 32, "name": "Nespresso Boutique Bar", "neighborhoods": ["Ville-Marie"], "open": true, "business_id": "_QP-vfoxfFvKMdArsoQ3Bw", "full_address": "2045 Rue Crescent\nVille-Marie\nMontr\u00e9al, QC H3G 2C1", "hours": {"Monday": {"close": "18:30", "open": "09:00"}, "Tuesday": {"close": "18:30", "open": "09:00"}, "Friday": {"close": "21:00", "open": "09:00"}, "Wednesday": {"close": "18:30", "open": "09:00"}, "Thursday": {"close": "21:00", "open": "09:00"}, "Sunday": {"close": "18:00", "open": "10:00"}, "Saturday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "09:00"}}, "reviews": [{"username": "Laurent", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "c0f2A0nLA8t4OOW7TIR2UQ", "review_id": "zVLrfK-l2MU3h3bU_bcEXA", "text": "Nespresso just opened in Montreal, same concept than in New York.\n\nThe place is stylish and you can have a coffee at the Bar on the ground floor and then buy your pods at the boutique on the first floor.\nFirst the coffee is excellent, it comes from the small pods and you can have some nice food as well.\nSeconf, you can buy the machine for your home (it is their objective of course) and then buy your pods online or in the location.\nA good place to have a good espresso, latte or Cappuccino , the only small negative, you can feel from the service that the place is new.", "business_id": "_QP-vfoxfFvKMdArsoQ3Bw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Ariel", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "PmD7M5tdVFeyxLA7a7QglQ", "review_id": "1BoYwgLhOUtm7dr0tCvTUA", "text": "The MOST pretentious coffee shop I have ever been to.

She then proceeded to say \"it's gonna take me a while\" when we ordered 2 dozen of the tiny treats! Why was it going to take so long? I was a little disappointed to see only 3 of many flavors and had hoped to try some of the other creative flavors. I am guessing it is hard to have so many in stock on a daily basis though. For future reference...the Cherry Cola one is delicious!\n\nGreat prices, yummy treats and you can even mark the spot where you are taking the cupcakes on a big map!

Just got back from four days in Henderson / Vegas and I got a room here that was a comp, so I have no  clue how much it even costs, but here is the low-down. Its obviously a bargain type hotel/ casino. They do have a $1.00 breakfast to bring people in, and its marginal, but as soon as you walk in the doors of the hotel/casino, you instantly get that tobacco smell that seems to linger until you get in your non-smoking room, provided thats where you are. The run down elevators are a microcosm to what kind of place it is, but the rooms are clean and the air works so once inside, its a decent and roomy place. Surprising was the bed I had. Actually a comfortable mattress, so the decent black-out curtains allowed me to sleep in a bit. i can't comment on the gambling there since I don't gamble, but overall, my experience was decent. I advise you to stay away from the lunch buffet. Bland food, orange colored water they pass off as orange juice, and our waitress seemed like she couldn't wait to get home. Can you blame her? \n\nI've always thought, if you want to know how the food is, look around at the people eating it. After looking at the people eating it, I wanted to get the holy H out of there.

We found this little gem on the way back from visiting Hoover Dam 2 weeks ago on our vacation in Vegas and decided to check it out.  It was cold and windy outside of the casino somewhere in the low 40's.  For 2 Hawaii people that is frigid.  Walking into the casino to the welcoming warmth was wonderful.   Since we never went to Railroad Pass during the morning hours I can't comment on their breakfast or lunch or the crew who work the early shifts.  Our visits were always after 5:00 p.m. through about midnight.\n\nOur focus when we travel to Vegas is craps and we headed to the crap table delighted to see the table minimum was only $1.  The crew there  is absolutely the best.  They  were warm and friendly and we can't say enough about the pit boss \"Monte\" who is by far the nicest pit boss we have met in all of Vegas.  We could tell he genuinely likes people and we felt welcomed by him and his crew.\n\nAfter shooting craps we headed to the rear of the cozy casino the the Iron Rail Cafe.  The hostess, Darla, was warm and pleasant just like the rest of the employees there.  Our waitress, Cheryl, was also very efficient and nice.  I had the salmon and my husband had steak.   The fish was moist and flaky meaning it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  My husband's steak was cooked medium rare, the way he ordered it.  The second time we both had steak and shrimp and that was cooked well too.   I didn't care much for the chicken breast appetizers because they were dry and overcooked, but the potato skins, buffalo wings and fried mozzarella were good.  The vegetables that come with the entrees are canned instead of fresh or frozen.   Probably the best surprise was their banana cream pie!  It is deliciously fresh and creamy and sinful.  We had to eat it again the next time we visited there because it surpasses any banana cream pie we have eaten.  Yes, we even chose it over the strawberry shortcake which I hear is awesome.  \n\nFood aside, we drove all the way out to Henderson 4  times during our trip mainly to spend time with the crew and gamble.  If we had discovered Railroad Pass the first week of our vacation we would have gone there even more often.  It was out of our way really but that is how much we like it there.   You can't beat a $1 minimum crap table with an awesome crew.  By the way, the slot machines we played seemed to be a bit looser than other casinos so I actually made some money a couple of times and didn't lose as much as I normally do at other casinos.\n\nWe feel at home at Railroad Pass and would like to experience staying there for a couple of nights to see what that is like.  The only reason I didn't mark this casino at 5 stars is because we haven't spent  any time lodging there.

This was probably the worst mistake of the trip.  Yes, the buffet was only, seriously, $7/person, but I now understand why.  Ugh.\n\nThe theme of the buffet was \"Asian\" food, so I knew it wouldn't end well.  No one should really cook \"Asian\" food unless they are actually Asian.  (....and I'm pretty sure the chefs were there not of any sort of Asian descent.)  I lightly sampled some of the \"safe\" foods, like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, pot stickers and fried rice.  Mistakes.  All of them.  \n\nI then opted for the sandwich bar and scarfed down some roast beef.  I left feeling pretty ill (like, really), so I'm not sure if I can attribute that feeling to the food or to sun poisoning.  Either way, I still can't bring myself to eat a roast beef sandwich without associating it with this buffet.

I got the orange chicken, pot stickers, and pork fried rice...and took one bite from each..and about died from an overdose of sodium.  Overall the food was so salty and mushy it was unedible.  My wife opted to give the salad bar a shot, which was fine till she tried the carrot stick which was mushy on the outside but still frozen rock hard on the inside.  We decided dessert was probably the safest thing to try, so we grabbed a pecan pie, and a brownie...how bad can that be right...Well the pecan pie resembled the carrot, extremely mushy on the outside and frozen solid on the inside.  The brownie was edible, but not by much.

I have been visiting it since 2006. It was a difficult decision whether to give it a 3 star or 4 star rating. The deciding factor was Railroad Pass Casino' s support and connectivity to Southern Nevada's precious River Mountains Loop Trail. Because I adore the River Mountains Loop Trail, I rounded my rating up to 4 stars. I separated my review on Railroad Pass into sections.\n\nThe Entrance:\n\n  Let me get to the point. Railroad Pass is no Bellagio.. It is an old school casino off US 93 at the Boulder City and Henderson border. It is not aiming for high rollers. Railroad Pass gets people into their property through inexpensive food and beer. When we drive toward Boulder City we have all seen the Railroad Pass sign advertising a rib or buffet special. Hanging from the building is an advertisement for $1 beer.\n\n  The parking lot is all surface. Toward the back of the building there is a trailhead parking lot of the River Mountains Loop Trail. There are more mobile homes than Corvettes parked in this parking lot.\n\nThe public areas:\n\n   The casino is small. Totally old school. Immediately after entering the casino, there is a bar to the left. On Saturday night there is an entertainer performing songs. I assume this is where the $1 beer is. To the right are the restaurants. The buffet looked unappealing. However, the Iron Rail Cafe is a value. This value also influenced my rating. I will be writing a review on it. In this area is the Railroad Bar and a steak house. If you continue straight from the entrance, you will pass computerized and table gaming. \n\n Halfway to the left is the Heritage Room. It is a small museum. It displays newspaper articles on the Hoover Dam and Boulder City. Being in a casino, it is expected that there are antique slot machines. \n\n  Further ahead  is the gift shop and hotel registration. There is insufficient literature on the rooms here. The only thing I could write about staying here is that MGM Resorts owns the property.\n\n  When I playef Caveman Keno here, it was old school all the way. This was my first gaming experience being served a beer by a man on the staff instead of by a cocktail waitress. The games are modern to the point that it is ticket in ticket out. Their website advertises $1 Craps and $3 Blackjack. \n\nThe Exit:\n\n  When you walk out of the Mirage you have the volcano. When you walk out of the Bellagio you have the Fountains. But, when you walk out of Railroad Pass Casino you have the River Mountains Loop Trail parking lot. The Railroad Pass Casino supports the River Mountains Loop Trail with a maintained parking lot and trailhead.In my opinion this is a better attraction than the Mirage Volcano. When I exit Railroad Pass Casino in the afternoon, I usually get onto the River Mountains Loop Trail.\n\n  Lately I have been visiting the Railroad Pass for dinner. After exiting, I hop on the 95 and Henderson is a few minutes drive away.\n\nThe Yelp 100 Challenge Review 34 of 100.", "business_id": "TInL9Ll_fd597SeEml0yLw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-02-28", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Stephanie", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "JbaZTaHjx_NGofU4BSMMvg", "review_id": "dXLcKq-1PcnyZM-SF-xF1g", "text": "Great food & super friendly staff!

Maybe the whole Hangover movie was putting out energy vibes my way or something. Anyway, here is my lighthearted and long winded review of the Casino/hotel that I stayed in. It is Tongue and Cheek of course but I wondered about it before I booked it so I am being thorough for my Yelpers. \n\nTo stay in Henderson or the Strip??? Well, it depends on your goal in Vegas. Ask yourself, \"Why am I in Vegas?\" Then of course keep it to yourself because of you know, the whole \"unwritten\" rule thing.-lol-- If you just want a place to sleep and have a car this is the best deal in town. It really is and I am not kidding. 49 bucks for a Sunday night stay in a full casino type of resort. (No crazy extra resort fees either) I think the next night was like 18 dollars a night. Jezhhhhh! I looked all over for a hotel/motel that was cheaper and came up with \"Nada.\" In fact most were double the price. I only needed one night to lay my head down before the long ride back home. I did notice though that their Saturday rate was 79 dollars. All other places were way over $150 for that date. \n\nI was all set to book another place for my one night. This place will remain nameless. Let's just call it the Norman Bates Inn. You know, it is one of those seedy motels hookers go to, in a very dubious part of Downtown/Strip. Let's also just say, it is an open style courtyard motel where all the doors open to the Morgue, Errrr,  Ummmmm, I mean parking lot, Ummmmmm, I mean street with no security, no services type of motel. You know the ones where they find dead bodies and all? And to boot, The Bates Inn even cost more. Now I am pretty brave at times, but why risk it? And why in the world would I pay more to view the oldest professions in town? \n\nSo, this was a great deal because it kept me alive being an enclosed casino and all, (Just kidding, or am I?) has a small, full service, not very busy gaming area, (nothing fancy schmanzy which works out great for me) a few restaurants, two bars, and even a Players Club. ( I got a free room to come back just for signing up. WOW!) I wonder if the Bates Inn has a Bar? Sorry, I digressed there for a minute and not sure I want to even ponder that thought too much. So in the end this was a \"steal\" for just needing a bed and saving 30 minutes on the car ride home. The staff members were all either nice, disinterested, or spectacular. More of them were on the wonderful side. The head of housekeeping is a \"Hoot\" and The servers in the Cafe were really, really, nice. I see other Yelpers mentioned that too. It is a well deserved comment because they really were like the nicest ladies I have ever met in an eating establishment. The food is not all that great but it is passable and they will try to make it right. \n\nPlease note, yes the rooms are very run down. This casino is very old. Historic. Check your key and paper to know what room you are really in despite what they tell you at the front desk. Now that's my first little secret Vegas story, wink, wink. The beds were pretty comfortable. I am not sure why another Yelper said no Alarm Clock. My room had a clock, lamps, beds, table, chair, wall unit ac that worked too freezing well, towels, iron, ironing board. Gosh Darn It, my room even had a TV too, not that I used it. The shower does have issues though. The shower is very old and is very hard to work. I got a great workout turning it on and off. I did notice some rust, or darker stains on the walls. I don't think it was mold but ya never know. (Just aged.) I personally did not care since it was clean. I was not in the room to spa it up or be fancy. I knew this was an old place before I got there and you should too. My room was just fine for the price.  Actually for the price I thought the room was even great. Go to the Strip if you want luxury. \n\nIf you plan on drinking or hanging on the Strip this hotel is NOT for you. It is too far away at 20 miles or a 35 minute drive. No drinking and driving please. I don't care about the whole \"unspoken rule\" thing when it comes to a DUI right? I helped someone who got hurt at the Smith Center because he was drinking, walking, and trying to drive. When I finally arrived back at this hotel after numerous witness statements I was drenched in blood. True story number two! And here I thought the whole blood thing would happen over at Bates.  \n\nSo, in a nutshell if you just need a room to crash or don't mind driving to your fun like a local, then stay here. \n\nPros- Price, safety, location, Railroad/Vegas history memorabilia, The bar has a great window view, And yes, a train comes by outside, small casino if you do not gamble \nCons- Location for Strip fun, run down/older facility if you want fancy, small Casino if you gamble\n\nChoo, Choo, Bye, Bye!", "business_id": "TInL9Ll_fd597SeEml0yLw", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-06-24", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Ashley", "votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}, "user_id": "3m5rsk7xoLddGrLK3Qi5rg", "review_id": "k_JZOfoF9JUWrTirxqO0yA", "text": "No frills casino, so don't expect it. \n\nIt could be more dedicated to it's history....

They do have keno and poker and some of the more modern penny games like Sex & the city and Breakfast at Tiffanys.\n The place is small but there are table games and an event room that they have some conventions or craft fairs sometimes. \n The staff for the most part are friendly, and their points seem to add up quick, or maybe you just need less points here to actually get something for your play. 8 points gets you a free buffet and they don't play games where they raise the price on holidays points wise. I can still use only 8 points on thanksgiving for an example. Mondays and Tuesdays are best for Seniors as they have specials.\n Usually a few days or so you can get 2x or 3x the points the specials change every month.\n The caf\u00e9 is fine.  Nice cheap deals and cheap strawberry shortcake. Some of the seating is a little small but the seating can be moved around a little if needed.\n The Steak house is better than I thought it would be. The steak was well made and the sides were great. The price wasn't too bad considering you can use points ( 50 points here, but worth it). I want to go again. Nice comfortable seating, dark and old school inside.\n The Buffet... ah the buffet. Well it all depends on when you go and your luck in general. One day they'll have everything hot and ready and have fresh chicken and tender steaks, thick prime rib and all your faves. The next day one look at the salad bar alone can send you screaming... I have had 4 star experiences and some less than 1 star experiences in this place. I suggest looking before you buy in. And they have a world night or Asian night... I forget which day of the week...

It had 2 squishy queen beds and outdated furniture. It was at least clean. It was exactly as I expected. \nThe Steakhouse... What crap. We arrived at 6:20pm without a reservation as this is not a happenin joint, even for a Saturday night. There were 3 tables that had people at them. We waited for a few minutes, no one showed up, we walked in and peaked around, no staff in sight, finally a nice lady appeared and said she would go get the matre d. She walks next door to the cafe and a few minutes later the matre d walks over with to go bags of food... from the cafe. He asked if we had reservations and we said no. He said they were highly suggested, looked in his reservation book as if the place was super booked, but he would go set us up a table. A few minutes later a bus boy asked if we had been helped and if we had reservations. We said someone was setting up our table and no we did not have reservations. He then lectured us in the most rude way about how they are appreciated as they fill up and we should have made them as a courtesy and acted as if we were lucky to be eating there. We also got to hear about how they need to make sure they have enough staff to cover the tables coming in. While hearing this, we see carts of food being wheeled from the cafe over to the diners in the steakhouse. Why am I paying $22 for shrimp scampi and $27 for a NY strip that is coming from the same guy making the burgers and grilled cheese for $6 in the cafe? How is this considered upscale (ya know, for Boulder City...) So 10 minutes after we finally get seated we get our waiter to take drink orders. He was very nice. Our food took 40 minutes to come out. Reminder, there were 3, maybe 4 tables at this point. The place never got busy, we never even had anyone seated near us. The place was a ghost town. The food was meh. It also was what I expected. The shrimp were large and delightful, but accompanied by soggy overcooked pasta, the NY was nothing special and came with what tasted like boxed garlic mashed taters and overcooked cauliflower with cheese sauce, the regular cut prime rib our grandfather had looked freaking amazing and was huge, the halibut grandma got looked decent, but I did not care to taste it. We didn't get out of there for almost 2 hours from the time we walked up, ate and got our check. We didn't have drinks, appetizers, or dessert. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't act as if you are some fancy ass Strip steakhouse. Tourist aren't lining up and neither are the locals. Get a freakin grip. You need to do something about your awful staff. If you are going to act like a snobby steakhouse, then at least be nice to your guests, lower your prices and/or make better food.", "business_id": "TInL9Ll_fd597SeEml0yLw", "stars": 2, "date": "2014-05-10", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Dave", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "yME2Jpi-y3yzU9hWzOM9VQ", "review_id": "G4J9xvNGH7Qgvsyyj-9osA", "text": "Ok so i secretly like this place.

We came from spending two nights in a lodge inside the Grand Canyon, eating one meal in each of the lodge's restaurants, meeting plenty of park staff, and this hotel/casino, in the middle of the desert, had, by far, the best staff and food of anywhere we'd been.  Everyone, from the front desk staff, to the security guards, to the servers was exceedingly nice and courteous, and always had a smile on their faces.

Well that my friends is the Railroad Pass Resort & Casino's Sunday Champagne Brunch.\n\nLast Sunday morning my boyfriend and I both woke up and we were both trying to convince one another to make breakfast. Well, that wasn't happening for either of us. I popped opened my handy computer and began looking up inexpensive brunches in Las Vegas. That's when I found the Sunday brunch at Railroad Pass. It was listed at just $7.99 per person which for a breakfast buffet with champagne is a stellar deal.\n\nWhen you visit Railroad Pass, do not expect the Wynn. They are an older property that brings you back to old Vegas. It's like you're stepping back in time which is pretty cool. \n\nWhen we arrived to the buffet, we found the price had jumped up to $8.99 which was fine. We entered and were quiet surprised at the selection they had. They had french toast, breakfast sausage, bacon, all sorts of fresh fruit, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, desserts, cereal, an omelet station and even fresh hash browns! \n\nThis is a great find and I recommend anyone who's willing to drive out to Railroad Pass do so and quick, before everyone else catches on and they raise the price!", "business_id": "TInL9Ll_fd597SeEml0yLw", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-22", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Holly", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "bxJNQrA4OUVE7MqfnBcscw", "review_id": "8vK_T6P-93WqBngHAcyI3w", "text": "This was my family's first trip to Vegas and we were flying blind when it came to hotels and restaurants but we felt like we hit the jackpot with staying in this hotel!\n\nThe rates were great, the food is great, the service is great! I did not meet one single staff member that was not friendly and happy to see us. I think that says a lot for how they are treated as employees. \n\nI love the history of the hotel and the surrounding area. It was close enough to drive to the strip but far enough away to offer a desert get away feel. We had many options for sight seeing from this location including Hoover Dam, sight shot to connect to the highway for London Bridge, and the strip. If you are traveling with kids, I highly recommend taking a ride on the Nevada State Railroad Museum train which can be seen from the hotel. \n\nIf you are looking for glitter covered everything, do not stay here. This place is small compared to what the strip offers and not as showy. I recommend staying at this place for the old country feel and the amazing history that it holds. \n\nThe only negative point I have is that the room did not have a bath tub, just a stand alone shower. This I do not hold against the hotel because we failed to inform them we had a toddler with us and needed a bath tub for our stay.\n\nI loved this hotel and will for sure be back.", "business_id": "TInL9Ll_fd597SeEml0yLw", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-07-24", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Hillery", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "uXkRc2ZW0kO2RnppTbgruw", "review_id": "CppbTCMFe2TTL2Fly3f1rA", "text": "Only for the buffet, I live close by and thought I would try it, since my friend has wanted to go there forever.

VERY good.\nVanilla Creme Brulee: Not the heavy kind in the ramakin, but light custard, with a delicate brulee top. Excellent without being heavy or over-filling.\nThe prices are extremely fair, even for mixed drinks. \nService was top notch--Bob and Marife were excellent.

Being a bagel obsessed person, I drove around until I was in front of Big Apple Bagel Express. As it was around 4:30 pm, the store was closed, but there was always tomorrow. I looked them up on the Internet, and found out that they make breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as several different types of muffins. The next morning, I got to the store around 8am. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful smell!\nThe store was bright and very clean. There was a glass display case to the right of the register that was stocked with many different types of bagels, as well as 8 favors of muffins. Each muffin was offered in a bite sized mini muffin, and a jumbo muffin (very large). I was greeted by two very pleasant guys, I'd guess the owners. I purchased 6 bagels, 2 plain, 2 poppy, and 2 sesame. I also bought one each of the mini muffins (8) to taste test. I was told they were sold in 3's, so I added a second pumpkin spice. I got home and toasted up a poppy, added a little butter and some cream cheese. The bagel was crisp on the outside, dense and chewy on the inside. It was easily the best bagel I've had since leaving NY 8 years ago. I couldn't tell if the bagels were steam and bake, or boil and bake, but they were really good. The mini muffins were fabulous! I have hit the jackpot 1 mile from my house. I intend on going back to try a breakfast and/or lunch sandwich very soon. Highly recommended!\n\nMy only advice to the owners would be to bite the bullet and replace the generic \"Bagel\" sign with a custom sign on the strip mall directory sign on Wigwam. People would then have a better first impression of the business and its excellence.", "business_id": "jkLl4bE3kbZvuWIIxzI7jQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-10-08", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Brad", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "GS0Yf5ab5ZxVIOTxJttsXg", "review_id": "bDV6fxFy3pch1AYqUAjo4A", "text": "This place is crazy good.

It's funny that right before my very eyes I had been passing a shopping center with a bagel shop attached to a Teriyaki Madness. It just so happened that I needed to stop at the Pecos at Wigwam CVS when a Big Apple Bagels Express sign caught my attention. Instantaneously it became a mental bookmark and a few mornings later an experience that led to a second one. \n\n   Big Apple Bagels is a franchise with the motto that \"something big is always baking.\" That something big that they'd be baking was my BLT on a poppy seed bagel. The breakfast BLT with my choice of cream cheese (or spread) was $3.99. With the bagel sandwich, I sipped from a cup of Brewsters coffee. Currently they have a promotion where Brewsters coffee is approximately 50 cents. Before going forward I will discuss the BLT\n\nThe BLT:\n\n I am a fan of the BLT which is bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. The BLT really is one of my all time favorite breakfast sandwiches. At Big Apple, they added a couple of touches to the BLT experience. First the superfluous of jalape\u00f1o cream cheese altered the taste of the sandwich. Speaking of cream cheese, when you order a bagel with cream cheese the price increases from $1.29 to $2.59. In my opinion it pays to spend a $1 or less more on breakfast sandwiches. Back to the additional touches that Big Apple added to the BLT experience, secondly the delicious poppy seed bagel gave the sandwich a knockout taste. \nVerdict: BLT on poppy seed bagel: 4 stars\n\nNorthern Omelet:\n\n    Things were going to get better on my second visit. I had joined the Big Apple Bagel club which bestowed me with a complimentary cup of Brewsters coffee. On my second visit, I'd go for a different breakfast sandwich. Decisions! Decisions! That brings up another point; the people working here are patient and friendly. The employee who cooks the sandwiches saw that the person doing the ordering had a customer in front and took the initiative to ask what I wanted to expedite the process. I decided on the Northern Omelet. One more time, a poppy seed bagel delivered me to a New York state of mind. Between the two slices of poppy seed bagel, I tasted sausage, scrambled eggs, American cheese, a tomato, and green pepper. \n   Verdict: 3.5 stars\n\n Brewsters Coffee:\n\n      This is just a matter of opinion, and in my personal opinion I am not a fan of Brewsters coffee. I am not saying it is bad quality, or discouraging people from drinking it. In my taste it was a taste that I did not care for. \nVerdict: N/A.  Personal taste. \n\n  The strong points of Big Apple Bagels is that they serve a good bagel sandwich and provide exemplary customer service. My constructive criticism point is that they need to include a side dish with their value meals. Growing up then spending my young adulthood in New York, the typical bagel shop experience included a side of either potato salad or macaroni salad, plus a pickle. In my mind, a bagel minus a side is like eating a hamburger minus fries. Big Apple is not isolated in this. I have addressed this in an Einstein Brothers Bagels review. However, Bagel Cafe near Summerlin includes macaroni or potato salad with their bagel sandwiches. If Big Apple offered macaroni salad or potato salad, I'd probably be the Duke. But I'd be a Duke ordering the bagel to go because the taste of Brewsters coffee doesn't agree with my taste buds.\n\n   In conclusion, I am glad that when I walked out of CVS I saw a bagel shop. Hopefully there is a New York style Kosher Deli or pizza place that I have been passing almost everyday. Maybe I'll stop by a CVS or Walgreens and take a walk around that shopping center. At any rate, Big Apple Bagel is a Good bagel shop and I recommend it.", "business_id": "jkLl4bE3kbZvuWIIxzI7jQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2016-03-14", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Renee", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "H4zgl6VS-e9VLvcLpc2I0w", "review_id": "ljt1CrwHUXG_BUwY8IqpeQ", "text": "Can't beat .49 cent coffee!

We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.\n\nThe restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries, all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard, which is technically the back of the shop, and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit, with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud, as we had to fight to not only hear each other, but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted, I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good, especially when my fianc\u00e9 overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches, we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub, the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs, one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper, and another girl running the register.  In addition, one woman was running the hot sub station on her own, the manager-type was taking cold sub orders, and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register, and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time, we had my fianc\u00e9's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name, she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused, so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out, it was my sub.  The name we had given, which was also on the ticket, was Bryan.  Yeah, not even close.  By that point, we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.\n\nThe subs weren't bad.  They weren't great, either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice, but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers, a bit too much cheese, and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's, and for what I paid, I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service, and at the very least, they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.", "business_id": "ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-02", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Anthony", "votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 10, "cool": 8}, "user_id": "AYGHNy8gPxl2Q-etTT3hZw", "review_id": "j03lSrdYAHyx__DCroLm5g", "text": "I stopped by this location at 11:30 on a Friday, before the lunch hour- or so I thought...

I placed my order, picked my toppings and went to pay. Each employee was very nice, and the cashier and I were even joking back and forth, and it was really nice. It wasn't forced corporate speak, they were just nice and seemed excited about their product.\n\nThe sammie was very good, and while not as good as a Mom & Pop deli, it was good and the bread actually appeared as though it had seen an oven. The meat is sliced fresh (cannot understand why people eat at Subway, where it just sits, pre-sliced, for days). The veggies and condiments are fresh and plentiful.\n\nTips for success:\n-Carpool.

I asked for a #6 with lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and when I stated this the lady behind the counter rudely stated \"you mean mikes way\" I said sure but I did not want onions and she said even louder this time \"so you mean mikes way without the onions.,\" again I said sure. I then stated that I did not want oregano. There was an order right after mine which was a #6 as well except this time the oder came with onions and oregano.  At this point my sandwich was fine, but then when the woman began putting oregano on the sandwiches she went down the whole line (including mine) and put oregano on each one. I told her that was not what I ordered and rather than either starting over or taking off the lettuce which now had oregano all over it, she proceeded to swap my sandwich with the one behind mine, forgetting that that one had onions. I told the woman that I didnt want onions either and she looked up at me and gave me the rudest look from a restaurant employee I have ever seen. She the proceeded to take off the layer of lettuce and replace everything without oregano. The only thing that I can say for the service of this place were the two people checking people out who commented on my earrings (which made my day) and then guy cleaning the counter who was on his first day on the job, I can do with out the rude sandwich lady.", "business_id": "ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-01", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Keely", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "IJKdg7KSekmIm_6LJsfvUw", "review_id": "vN1tA3XiLa9BHag7ze1cIQ", "text": "For a chain sandwich shop this place is awesome.

Just nails is the business I refer acquaintances to after they have had a botched nail job, or worse had a bad nail/skin reactions to products at other salons. I am a germaphobe and watch with an eagle eye sanitation practices at spas and salons.   Hygiene at the nail stations is superb. Never worry that a tool will touch your finger that has not been sanitized. A towel may have a loose thread, but you can trust that is because it gets washed often.  The techs at just nails understand both the art as well as the science of nail care. Staff turn over is minimal, reflecting the high degree of professionalism and experience you can expect.  Most senior techs are experienced nail artists, by that I mean they can actually paint one of a kind designs on a nail.  If you want high quality nail care with knowledgable and skilled staff, just nails is the place.  The owners and staff are gracious and kind. You can also enjoy \"smart talk\" with techs if you want to discuss something more than the color of your nails.

Bought a specialty cake for pick-up over the weekend for my 3yr. old son's birthday. Went to cut the cake for the birthday party and it was frozen in the middle. I called to let them know and they told me they would have a manager call me on Monday and there was nothing they could do for me that day since they didn't have any other cakes unfrozen. Not the end of the world I thought and we would just have to eat the cake the next day. Then about 15 minutes later received a phone call back from Potomac telling me I had to return the uneaten portions of the cake and get a partial refund- I was floored. They messed up here not having my cake ready yet I had to return the cake for a PARTIAL refund for what wasn't eaten??? Absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error. I explained that I disagreed with this policy and they should be making an effort to correct the situation of sending me a cake that wasn't ready, they explained that this was their policy and were not willing to work with me. \n\nI expected a call Monday from management apologizing for their staff handling the situation incorrectly but never was called.

Whoever designed that system was an idiot.  \nAs I said, it was a Tuesday afternoon and there was a queue for the fitting rooms.  Not that they were all full, mind you, there were plenty of free rooms, but the one girl manning them has to register how many items you are taking into the dressing rooms - it's some weird electronic system where she puts in that big plastic thing that says how many items you have.  Then when you're done, you have to wait for her to help other people and then re-scan your big plastic thing.  \n\nAdditionally, many people have baskets of items they're not taking into the dressing rooms with them, and those baskets must be dealt with by the one girl who is also scanning everyone into their dressing rooms.\n\nIt is absolutely the most ridiculous system I have ever seen in my life.  Even on a slow afternoon, one person is far from adequate for dealing with a dressing room!  I shudder to consider how awful it must be during the weekend.

That alone tends to terrify me about joints like this - how anyone can sell a winter jacket for $12 is beyond me. \n\nBut if you can stomach the bright lights and badly constructed crop tops and acid washed jeans (when did the 90's come back?!), this place, like others of its kind, is pretty decent for the staples.\n\nIn all my huffing, puffing and general distaste for the whole experience, I did manage to make it out with about 10 pairs of tights and a cheapo pair of flats. All which came out to a hilariously minimal total of $21.\n\nSo if your seeking survival tips and a new scarf - maybe venture in here. But plan a spot for a quiet tea and meditation afterwards.

I went on Yelp for help, of course, and there, opening at 8.30am, it was the delights of Primark. Yay! This was my chance when out for my breakfast I could swing by and pick up some jammies and cosy slippers. I tell you it's definitely the best time to shop, it was dead. I had the whole shop to myself. I was just gutted I didn't have long as I was off to work not long after. \n\nEach time Angela B. and myself have been in Edinburgh we have a NEED to stop by. Angela said she thinks the stock is a little better/different from the Glasgow stores. She knows her Primark stock, I swear she lives in Primark sometimes. Hehe!! \n\nEvery visit, it's been fine and not too busy. We must just pick good days and times and it's been a fun and a good experience. \n\nThere's plenty of mirrors on the shop's floors and we've been able to try on some of our precious finds. It's affordable and we can spend quite a bit of time in there, lost in ladies lovelies, dresses and coats. The scene from Father Ted did pop into my head while we wandered through the bras.

During my time at UW Falbo's was always the late-night pizza of choice for my roommates and me.  When I was a freshman I remember walking to their old University Avenue location to grab a slice for lunch.  As I continued my storied and distinguished college career I always seemed to be in proximity to Falbo's.  For two years I lived a block away from the Park Street location.  There were plenty of nights where I'd come home at bar time to find my roommates playing PS2.  They'd call in an order and then give the money.  I'd go pick it up so as to not disturb their video game.  Our arrangement was great, and I don't think I paid for pizza more than a couple times over those years.  Fast forward a few years: I'm out of college and working for a living.  There are no more bar time nights or roommates, well at least no roommates.  I've even moved out to the suburbs.  But imagine my surprise when I realize that there is an outpost of college nostalgia in Middleton - a Falbo's not much  more than five minutes down the road.  \n\nI was first clued into this shocking development a couple months into my first apartment in Middleton.  A friend from college was in town and couch surfing at my place for a week, and after one Thursday night at the Boar we stumbled back to my place and he wanted to order a pizza.  I told him that I didn't know of much in the area, just a Domino's and Buck's, but I improvised and grabbed a phonebook from the pile in the lobby.  I didn't believe it at first, but the Falbo's guy confirmed that they were in fact located in Middleton, at 12 & Century.  Thirty minutes later we had our pizza and it was great.\n\nFalbo's pizza is the gold standard for what I consider \"college pizza\" - thin crust pepperoni & cheese, delivery late into the night.  My tastes have grown since college and I prefer the specialty pizzas at Roman Candle and Picasso's to the old pepperoni & cheese standard, but it's hard to go wrong with the delicious simplicity of a well-made pie.  The best aspects of Falbo's are the thin crust and the cheese.  The pizza is never too greasy or soggy.  Over the last few years I don't believe I've ever ordered anything but that old college standard, pepperoni & cheese, and although I know they've got a big menu I've never really delved into it.  If I ordered delivery more often then I'd probably know more about what they have, but almost every situation has been one where a friend is coming over or is staying and I want to order something quick and simple.  Falbo's is perfect for this, and if I've got the time I can run over there for pick-up and save a couple of minutes.  I don't think Falbo's is the best pizza in Middleton - I like Roman Candle for this.  But Falbo's is the best for quick and fast delivery, and for me recalls some of favorite memories of my college years.", "business_id": "BtqIbQ44Pa7-4pAIfPnc9Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-06", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Charles", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "aiNWxSrNrRI3cgwbH4vw0A", "review_id": "fT0k8c1zqYYDNuEA1N28yw", "text": "The best pizza in Middleton.

Why? Because you never know what you'll find here.  I've been coming to this Craig Road drug store since 2008 when I visit family.  It's only about 2 miles from my sister's house. And it's like 7-11 when I need something quick, like men's grooming stuff, sodas, magazines for my flight back to OC, snacks, and medicine.  Some of my relatives have even had prescriptions filled when their regular pharmacist was closed.  At times, there might be up to 4-5 people in line but most of the time, I'm in an out of there faster than I can eat a chocolate.  It's catty corner from the Mormon run Desert Industries Thrift store, and across Craig from the Shell station. \n\nIn Christmas 2011, CVS actually helped save my Christmas.  The family gathered in Vegas like we always do. I bought my mom what she wanted, a not too fancy black or grey rain repellent jacket from the mall.  Since I didn't want her to have to return it, I gave it to her on Christmas Eve, early in case something was wrong.  And nothing was really wrong...it's just that she hinted she preferred a jacket with a detachable hood.  \"Oh, this hood isn't detachable..\" Even clueless me can take that hint. Like any good son or daughter, it was a mad sprint to the car and mall. \n\nI went back to the mall, which I hated.  Driving there I felt like a cab driver in New York City, everyone was rude, crude, and stressed. No  one had the right size or color...all their stuff was picked over.  Frustrated, defeated, and driving back, I took a break and went into this CVS store for a soda, and checked out their boxed cologne sets.  Like a \"Miracle on 3655 Craig Road\", there was a rain repellent jacket, medium weight, in black, with a detachable hood.  Clothing at CVS?  Exactly what she wanted for $20!  And I had a few $20's to give her for gambling at Aliante casino. And, I will just refund the other jacket  in Cali since I have the receipt.  The cashier was brand new, but really nice. And during Christmas mass above her imported silk dress, my mom wore the new inexpensive and very useful coat from CVS, the Coat Value Store.

Had a bunch of friends who also attended separately and....\n\nIt was great!\n\nIt's not fancy (which I couldn't care less about) but the people were as nice and friendly as could be and the food was stellar.\n\nHaving a father from Canton, China, I grew up eating Cantonese food all my life and only recently have been trying other regional Chinese cuisine - thanks to some good friends.\n\nFrom what I understand, they have imported a Cantonese chef and a Sichuan chef from China. Not positive but the food tastes like it could be the case.\n\nWe went with the kids & had 5 dishes. All were fantastic.\n\nSalt & pepper calamari - delicious.  Light & flavorful. The kids devoured these.\n\nScallion pancakes - absolutely loved. Simple but super tasty.  Will be a staple on subsequent trips.\n\nWater boiled fish - this dish was phenomenal. I'm still pretty new to the properties of Sichuan peppercorns but I love them. Fish was excellent with some kind of bean sprout some celery in a spicy sauce. If you're not familiar with Sichuan peppercorns, the start slow & then the heat builds & builds. The really cool thing is that they also have a numbing quality. Same thing. Starts slow & builds & builds. I love it. My friend mentioned to me how you get to a point where when you drink water, it almost seems carbonated from the numbness. Couldn't have loved this dish more.\n\nYu Xian eggplant - this might have been my favorite of the night. I'm not a huge, huge eggplant fan all the time as it's just too soft of texture for me at times. This was still quite soft but the sauce just made it amazing. It's hot, sour, salty & sweet at the same time. Probably my favorite eggplant preparation ever. Think there was also some minced pork in there. Great, great dish.\n\nAnd then we finished with..\n\nLai Tangyuan (glutinous rice balls served in soup) - these were lovely as well. They had a delicate, thin skin & were stuffed with a sweet sesame paste and were served in a sweet clear soup. Great way to end the meal.\n\nSuper reasonable as well. \n\nFor me, a great, great new spot for us.

Its hard to even pick a favorite dish.\n\nDan Dan Noodles. Nice Chinese pulled noodles with an oily chili sauce and minced pork. These were mouth numbingly hot, but incredibly flavorful and one of most memorable dishes for me. I could have at the whole bowl on my own.\n\nLamb Ribs - Dry rubbed and flash fried. Tossed with Chilies and more dry spices. Fantastically addicting.\n\nEggplant as stated on the last review was wonderful even to someone who doesn't really like eggplant.\n\nGreen Beans with chopped pork. They are the ones in the pictures. Lightly pan fried and tossed with chili oil and chopped pork. The smokiness from the slight char on the green beans mixed with the chewiness of the pork was simple yet inspiring. \n\nThe last reviewer's description of the water boiled fish was spot on. But I must reiterate how fantastic this dish was. There is a depth to the sweet and sour broth that makes you go back for more and more trying to figure out the different notes. Super spicy, but yet balanced with a different kind of Chinese sprout and a bit of Shiso. Wonderfully complex and even gets better as it cools. The fish was clean, fresh, and delicate cooked.\n\nA few members of our group speak Cantonese and talked to the chef for quite some time, before, during, and after the meal. They did indeed fly 2 chefs in for this restaurant and it seems to have paid off. The 2 do every single bit of preparation themselves with no help, and have friendly rivalry going in the kitchen. It makes for an amazing back and forth through the entire meal, with each dish better than the next. By the end of the meal we were even invited to take a peek in the tiny kitchen.\n\nAnd o what a tiny kitchen it was. (for a kitchen in Phoenix). The kitchen is super tiny, the building is pretty beat up, but everything is impeccably clean, and the cuisine was honestly some of the best I've had outside of China\n\nAll in all we spent 3 hours at this place.

Both were big, spicy, and very filling. \n\nI added some excitement to the place by accidentally splashing some of the very spicy sauce from the Bean Thread (noodles) into my eye. I literally could not even open my eye afterward, so one of the waiters led me by the hand, blind, to the bathroom so I could rinse it out. The whole restaurant staff was very concerned, and everyone in the place cheered when I emerged from the bathroom. No harm done. \n\nI returned to the table to find the Water-Boiled Fish and the Yu Xiang Eggplant we ordered waiting for me. First of all, the serving sizes are enormous. Each entree could easily feed two people. They were both delicious, but the eggplant was seriously some of the best food I've ever tasted. They must have some sort of drug in the sauce, because it just wipes your mind of everything you're thinking about and overwhelms you with deliciousness. \n\nNo dessert for us because there was basically an entire dinner left on the table.

Sure, \"hot n sour\" soup is a Chinese restaurant staple, but this one took the eye-watering, nose-running spicy-hot cake.

It was so worth it.  I'll be back with more specifics on the dishes we tried, but highly recommend the glutinous rice balls with the sweet sesame paste dessert.  Delightful in itself, a light, not \"heavy\", lightly sweet dessert, a wonderful compliment to the meal as well as a utilitarian palate-cleansing restorative to the spice-numbed tongue, though from a marketing perspective I might recommend they come up with a more appetizing pseudonym for \"glutinous rice balls\".  \"Large Intestine\" perhaps?   \n\nHighly recommend.

My palate and my mind have been blown completely away by the flavors that I experienced tonight.  Thank you Norm R for organizing the UYE.  \n\nI ordered the Spicy Lamb Ribs and the Garlic Pork Belly, both were delicious items.  The Spicy Lamb Ribs dish is seasoned with the Schezchuan pepper.  That pepper is not in the family of HOT like the jalapeno.  That pepper makes your mouth tingle and feel numb when you eat the food.  There was an appropriate balance of salty with the zingy-ness of the pepper.  I came to learn when our dinner was over that the chef toned down the spice level for my American palate.  I'll say that is a huge mistake because I wondered why they would give that a 4/5 star hot star rating.  They should have asked me.  I will be sure to request the correct spice level if I order that again.\n\nFortunately for me, I had dinner there with about 10 other Yelpers (Jeff E, Laura I, Jared R, Chrystalle B, Tom S, Liz S, Norm R, Robert O, John M, Teresa S and Mario C).

Being a Friday night it was a bit busy and then we all came in.\nThe hot Tea and the Ice Tea are imported from China and are wonderful, full body and strong but, not bitter.\nAs you can see from all the other reviews the food runs the scale. All divine, and all different types of flavor.\nI had Eggplant in a brown sauce AWESOME!  The vegetables here are so fresh.\nIt is as if they just picked them from the garden. Green beans,mmm I have never had better. The food was piping hot when it was brought out to us as well.\n\nAs I learned here they do not add anything that should not be there. \nIt is not salted,or no sugar, corn starch or artificial flavor or color. Of course absolutely no MSG. This is pure food and all for a very reasonable price.\nThe rice is included with every dish. \nWe were able to try a Szechuan pepper dish,LAMB that was amazing! I have never tasted any thing like it in my life. As well as Bitter Melon ,which comes from the gourd family. An amazing anti oxidant food that is an acquired taste they say.\nBut, if you have a bite of each of the amazing items you get the full experience.\n\nWe were so lucky to have Norm there who knew a lot about the traditional Chinese foods and how they should be eaten and what to expect.\nWe also had Won Ton in Chile sauce appetizers that were spicy and oh so good.\n\nEvery thing here is amazing and we are truly looking forward to our return visit.\n\nThe dining area is large so it is good for groups, but I would give them a heads up first. They like to have all fresh items  to cook for you.\nClean bathrooms and you will park in the lot in the back of the restaurant.", "business_id": "Az_IY3TgnOcnh1dXd7GZLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-03-23", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Mark", "votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 7, "cool": 3}, "user_id": "diDUDx82VePOC1hObkHwMw", "review_id": "THwebrrOeJDCXV6jVznILg", "text": "Behold right out of no where we now have Authentic Sichuan and Cantonese flavors right at our fingertips.

It is fun to hear people speaking Chinese while they enjoy their food. I like hot and spicy so the Sichuan menu is the side I have been working on so far. Ordered the Wonton in Spicy and Sour Sauce and they were so tender. Tried the Sichuan Hot and Sour Beanthread Noodles which was interestingly good. Yu Xiang Eggplant so far is my favorite as well as any of the Sichuan water boiled dishes. The table next to me ordered several Cantonese dishes and they looked really tasty and colorful.

Food was superb as usual. More staff on hand so service was prompt.\nTwo changes of note, the Cantonese chef has been replaced; and they have stopped serving soup in a cup. Now the smallest portion is a full bowl, unfortunate in that the cup was just the right size for a one person appetizer. \nThere were several people there, even at lunch on a Friday.\n\nOriginal:\nWe had our first meal here today. To say the least, it is the first 5 star Chinese Restaurant I've ever been in. The young owner met us at the door, as we were the first diners for the day. Seated us promptly etc. While we were perusing the extensive menu we ordered a couple of bowls of hot and sour soup and a pot of hot tea. \n\nFor our meal, I ordered the Water Boiled Fish Fillet ,my wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken we also ordered the Saut\u00e9ed Green Beans along with white rice.\n\nTo start with the Hot and Sour soup was excellent, a nice medley of vegetables in a clear brown stock. Definitely on the hot (pepper) side.\n\nOut first came the Kung Pao Chicken and the rice. Superb; very flavorful spicy (spices) and some heat (peppers). The owner told us he imports the spice used in the dish directly from China. I have had Kung Pao at several restaurants in the area over the last two month. None can come even close.\n \nNow we had our chance to sample the water boiled fish fillet. Again a hit. Spicy (spices) and hot. The dish we were informed again had a special spice from China that brought up the flavor without overpowering the dish. Here again I have had fish prepared in this manner recently, but it was bland, lacking flavor.\n\nNow the surprise of the meal - the Saut\u00e9ed Green Beans. they are a wonder indeed. Just delicately fried to a limp consistency with the right spice mixture and ground pork. It's a must try on anybody's list.\n\nTo sum up.

I was also contacted by the owner of Miu's, who was extremely apologetic over our bad experience and let me know that he'd taken concrete steps to sort out at least a few of the problems I mentioned in my original post, re: they have a larger staff and more delivery dudes now.  He also let me know that you can request less oil on the Sichuan portion of the menu.  Perhaps one of these days I'll get a wild hare and decide to try Miu's again.  For now, though, I'm bumping them up a star.  A cult following and kind, polite customer service do not mouth-watering fare make... but they definitely help.  \n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nSo, I'm wondering if our delivery guy was jumped on the way over and, instead of being mugged, was forced to switch out all of the delicious goodies we ordered for some of the worst Chinese I've ever had.  \n\nOf course, there are some of you who will look at my photo and point out triumphantly, \"Oh, but you're a white girl!  OF COURSE you didn't like *real* Sichuan or Cantonese, your palate is crap!\"  Not true, friends.  I am a former Chicagoan, San Franciscan and New Yorker.  I have prowled the grungy alleys of 'Chinatowns' from, literally, sea to shining sea.  I have more than dabbled in traditional Sichuan, and when I read all of the glowing reviews on Yelp, I was practically panting with excitement as I called up to place a delivery order at Miu's.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks- I realize the restaurant is in its infancy, and so I'm not going to judge the service too harshly here.  There were a few mishaps as I ordered (not shocking, since I ordered based on other Yelpers' reviews, having been unsuccessful at locating an actual menu), and the food took an hour and forty minutes to show up.  The driver was really nice, though, and they tossed some sort of tripe dish into one of the bags, presumably to make up for the wait.  \n\nHowever... the food.  Sweet fat christ on a bicycle, the FOOD.  WAS AWFUL.  We got the water boiled fish, the eggplant, the green beans, the wontons, and the dan dan noodles.  Not a winner among 'em. Let me preface that statement by telling you that Boyfriend and I are not picky.  We dumpster dive on a regular basis.  That's right, I'm telling you that I routinely eat things out of a garbage can, and that I still think the food at Miu's was terrible.  Now, I appreciate that Sichuan is usually very oily and spicy.  This is why I love it!  But it tasted as if they'd run out of peppers and so instead just dumped a bunch of salt in and crossed their fingers.  Imagine preparing a really lovely meal... and then dumping a quart of Crisco over it.  Bingo.  I really had my hopes up for the green beans in particular, but nope.  Too oily and mushy to even be recognizable as green beans and pork belly.  \n\nThat being said... maybe the staff was just having an off night?  The woman who took my order did say they were very busy, so perhaps our terrible meal was a reflection of a small kitchen and a staff stretched too thin.  I definitely will not be going back, but there are so many glowing reviews here that I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to chance it.

Most Chinese restaurants don't do such sauce because the high cost of labor and the cost of the pepper. My family been cook food using this method for years. About 2 pounds of peppercorn can produce about 1 teacup of the sauce. Miu's red \"oil\" is made this way. And we ordered about 10 Sichuan dishes the total for all that is only 130 !!

It's easy to miss the turn, and it's such a narrow driveway that a car cannot get in if another is trying to get out.  Just be on the lookout!  Once inside, the ambiance was strange.

They arrived slowly over the course of about 15 minutes, so it was a good thing we were planning on sharing everything rather than waiting for all the food to come out before we could start.  The eggplant and lettuce wraps were awesome, and the lo mein was fairly predictable.

No music or even an air conditioning vent murmuring. There were about three tables of people and they were all whispering. It was WEIRD.

Well this was ridiculous, we had enough food for 4 people, I don't know what she was talking about! I guess it gave us an opportunity to try a lot of things.

Then we got the wonton soup. The soup was pretty par for the course as far as wonton soups go. Another 3 star dish. Next we got the potstickers and those were a definite 1-2 star item....they were like the frozen potstickers you get from trader joes. That is always such a disappointment.

So finally we get the sesame pancakes and those are probably a 4 star, they were good, but not the best I have ever had. I am sure that this place has more gems like the eggplant, and that I would need to come back to try some other things that would maybe bump up the rating for this place. Here is my second complaint: The service was awkward and slow. We sat around with the food sitting out for about 30 minutes before having to call someone over (who was just standing there looking at us) to ask for a box. Then again we waited for another 10 min or so to get our check. In the mean time, the girls who work there were just standing there or walking by our table to another one of the 3 tables that were full in the restaurant. Also, it kind of looks like people live in the back of this restaurant, there were couches, a tv, people just hanging out behind a partition. Finally, they left the doors to the place wide open letting in a massive amount of flies that bothered us throughout the meal....I don't love having flies all over my food and one actually died in my friend's noodles and she had to pick it out.... yikes. I would give this place another shot, but, I have to say, I wasn't thoroughly impressed today.", "business_id": "Az_IY3TgnOcnh1dXd7GZLg", "stars": 3, "date": "2013-04-14", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Jared", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 7, "cool": 5}, "user_id": "XeoAojoz5johV2MQ5ngNig", "review_id": "zByXyfam3B86IgGB8yefsw", "text": "Came here as part of a UYE set up by Norm and I am really glad I made it. This place isn't your run of the mill chinese food. It is authentic (according to Norm) and full of unique flavors that differ from the chains and take out places. They actually pack a lot of flavor into their dishes and they are nice and spicy which I love but at the same time the heat isn't the only thing you taste.\n\nSince we all went semi-family style with it I got try a lot of dishes so here are some quick hits:\n\n-Kung Pao Chicken - My go to dish that is normally fairly lack luster but consistent elsewhere here actually had robust flavor and some healthy heat.\n\n-Szechuan Peppers- foudn these in various dishes and they were spicy but at the same time kind of mouth numbing which gave a unique taste and sensation. I liked it others may not.\n\n-Pork Belly (aka the Bacon part) - was really tasty and had some great sweet and spicy dumplings.\n\n-Onions and lamb- was my favorite just a great flavor combo here and well executed with great flavor of cumin.\n\n-Hot and sour- Good but lacked the hot part, especially when compared to other dishes on the night.\n\n-Bitter melon - It's an experience you need to try at least once. Get it to share since you probably won't eat the entire dish.\n\n-Eggplant - well cooked and flavor not over powered. Highly recommended.\n\n-Seafood and sizzling rice (rice cakes) - This was one of the stars of the night. \n\n-Lamb ribs and spicy peppers - great dish as the ribs were nice and crispy went well with the peppers that give the dish a nice punch.\n\nConsidering they have 2 large groups in the place at the same time and one of the servers was obviously new they did a great job getting things handled. The staff answered a lot of questions and took care of us well.\n\nI highly recommend this place as the quality and taste of the food can't be beat and the prices are right in line with your grab and go Chinese food places.", "business_id": "Az_IY3TgnOcnh1dXd7GZLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-04-25", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Liz", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}, "user_id": "V6rhoTCw7S6H8eHwv2M6Vg", "review_id": "s3TCCfbSt7F5-XdHtJkwkQ", "text": "words cannot describe.\n\nSeriously, these other reviews, their suggestions, those aren't lies.  \n\nGo.

I'd heard rumblings in the foodie grapevine that the food was worth checking out but if I wanted any ambiance, best to get takeout. \n\nWell, I'm not overly concerned with ambiance, which is good as this place is about as basic as you can get but basic as in simple and clean, which is fine. It seems they specialize in Szechuan (spicy!) and Cantonese (not so much) cooking and though the list of items is not as large as in some bigger Chinese restaurants it is still a pretty varied list, including a whole list of vegetarian options. \n\nI'd seen a review of this establishment on PHX Rail Food and based on that ordered the garlic cucumbers, which are amazing. They are the small and thin skinned Lebanese cucumbers cut into chunks and then bathed in a mix of raw garlic, a bit of salt, some hot chili oil (though not spicy), and possibly some rice wine, though I'm not sure, but this simple dish, delicious. The only challenge is that they are super difficult to pick up with chopsticks so had to break down and get a fork or you can eat them with your hands.\n\nWe also ordered some scallion pancakes which are decent and help act as a shoving instrument to get food onto your fork if needed. In addition, tried the pan fried potstickers (eh, nothing special but large), the cold chicken (delicious, and covered in a mix of chopped garlic, possibly with some diced scallions, and some rice wine vinegar, whatever it was, super tasty), and the braised eggplant (delicious, would so get that again). We also ordered some cooked rice and I don't know if they have brown rice but what they brought was good, nice and sticky.\n\nFinally, we did order some green tee, that could have been hotter. I like mine steaming hot and this was a but lukewarm but that is part of the basic charm. All that for two people came out to $30. My co-worker thought it was a but much but I'll disagree and say it was well priced for the quality of the food.\n\nI'm giving it five stars for the quality of the food and though the place was basic, the service was good. Speaking of that food quality, I've been to Japan a few times, and Hong Kong, and I truly felt I was overseas when eating this food, it was that good. I look forward to working my way through the rest of the menu items so  folks go check it out and if you don't like a basic dining atmosphere, get it to go. I don't think you will be disappointed.\n\n*Quick update - took the parents, we loved the twice cooked pork dish and once again, got an eggplant dish, wonderful! I also ordered the lamb ribs which come out looking like something form the food channel - small ribs, fried with just a bit of chewy meet left on them, but mixed in with a mound of dried hot peppers, fresh scallions, and possibly another spice or two (maybe cumin?) - suffice to say, spicy, though in a spice way as well as somewhat hot.

The wonton broth was super spicy, so good. And since we had such a big group, it was very much family style. Every single thing I tried was great if not better than that. The flavors were amazing. Several of the dishes had Szechuan peppers (very spicy) but all used in different ways. The lamb (all 3 variations I tried) was tender and flavorful. The bitter melon is definitely an acquired taste.\n\nThere is a bit of a language barrier between the wait staff and guests, Im guessing thats the reason that every dish on the menu is written in English and Chinese.

As many have said,  the place is in an iffy neighborhood but that never deters people like us and obviously other Yelpers either.  We entered through a door in the back located in the  parking area (as opposed to having an entrance facing the street).  Upon entering we noted that the decor was sparse if non existent (we don't eat decor!) but more importantly the place looked clean.  \n\nWe started with the Hot and Sour soup made with tofu instead of the usual pork.  The soup portion was generous and delicious worthy of 5 stars.  We both ate and still brought some leftovers home--at 5.95, a great value.\nMy hubby ordered the water boiled fish which got rave reviews in the New Times article and by other Yelpers.   But as others have said,  the wait staff has a bit of a problem with English and so it took a bit to find out the kind of fish it was.  According to the cook, it was sole.  When it arrived it was in a bowl with broth and swimming in a red oil.  So we began to scoop out the oily top and finally decided it was easier to move the fish and the veggies to a plate and eat it from there.  The fish was delicately cook and the veggies had some flavor but nothing to write home about.  He ate it but I didn't hear the usual oo's and ah's when he really likes something.  He ate it in silence which usually means, I ordered it so I have to eat it.  He ordered it at my suggestion since some people seems to enjoy it in the newspaper review but I guess all palates are not the same.  Next time I'll keep my \"gills\" shut.  \nI ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp which took quite a while to come out.  The waitress apologized and told me that the shrimp had been frozen and needed to be defrosted.  I expect frozen seafood in a land-locked state and it is certainly better than leaving them un-defrosted in a refrigerator to rot. slowly.  So the shrimp came out in a large plate with their heads and eyes looking at me.  I was not shocked after all this is a very authentic restaurant.  There were about 11 nicely sized shrimp on the plate but they were definitely not jumbo shrimp.  They had been cooked without breading (good) but with their scales on which I removed before I ate each one.  The shrimp were properly done with some onions and peppers on the bottom of the plate.  What it was missing was ginger.  Every single chinese restaurant where I have eaten this dish (NY's Chinatown as well) puts ginger as well as salt and pepper and sautes the shrimp in the mixture. I asked for ginger and they promptly brought me some.  By the way, the \"pepper\" in salt and pepper shrimp was missing.  So I ate the shrimp skipping the head and the eyes.  (I'm just not that good yet!)  I would give the shrimp for freshness and value of the dish, 4 stars.  \nThe water boiled fish and the salt and pepper shrimp were each $10.95.  I could understand the shrimp at that price but the portion of the fish was not that large and sole is not all that expensive.  I think they need to check their price points.  The prices at Mei's is almost equivalent to the pricing in Scottsdale chinese restaurants.  Considering the neighborhood, I think that the dishes may be a little overpriced.\nI realize that a new restaurant owner wants to re-coup his investment but too much too fast may not be a good strategy.\nBy the way, the young owner did come by our table to find out how everything was.   Very nice and very gracious.  \nI think Mei's is worthy of another try.  \nI will be generous this time and give them 4 stars.

The food is relatively authentic, but much more of a \"home-style\" than restaurant style. My biggest gripe is the food/price value of Miu's which is exceptionally abysmal. A 2 person meal ended up almost $50 for some appetizers, main course and some soup.\n\nPlease note, as I ordered in Chinese, I don't exactly know the English names used in the menu and even the Chinese names listed may not be exactly the same as the menu, but should be quite close to their dish name.\n\nCong You Bing (Scallion Pancake) - Extremely oily, no crispiness whatsoever and quite small. Almost certainly from a frozen package at about $4. Head to the frozen section in Lee Lee's or Mekong Plaza supermarket if you want a superior version (seriously).\n\nDan Dan Mian (Dan Dan Noodles) - Some cooked noodles resting above a spicy sauce (about a couple tablespoons worth) and you mix it up yourself. There's literally nothing else, no meat or soup just some green onion. Tastes okay, but not okay enough for another $4. This dish takes me back to my college years, eating cooked Top Ramen with mixed in Sriracha or something. Cost me about 20 cents.\n\nGuo Pa Soup (Sizzling Rice Soup) - Served as a relatively small bowl of soup and a plate of loose scorched rice. Imagine a clear broth with 2-3 shrimp pieces and 3-4 pork pieces with some mushrooms and veggies, with a side plate of baked loose rice krispies that somehow lost his marshmallow friend and couldn't combine into a block. Now maybe that sounds kind of appetizing, but in a decent restaurant this is normally served as a large block of scorched rice, resembling that of a Rice Krispie treat. You then are supposed to pour the soup on top of said rice block and it's supposed to snap crackle and pop as a savory soup/krispie combination with lots of meat and veggies. Instead, at Miu's you sprinkle this rice dandruff on your soup like some sort of liquid breakfast from another dimension. The meager amount of meat in this dish is mildly amusing until you remember you're out $8 for the privilege.\n\nMa Po Doufu (Ma Po Spicy Tofu) - Not bad tofu, spicy as expected. This was the dish I had least problems with during my experience, but it's pretty hard to screw up tofu mixed in with some spicy sauce. This is almost breakfast cereal levels in terms of  difficulty of \"construction\" so I'm not sure if I should be thankful I got an okay dish or sorry that I had to pay $8 for it.\n\nXuan Rong Bai Ji (Garlic White Chicken) - We ordered half a chicken which would seem like a lot of food, which came cold-cut with some garlic sprinkled on top. The garlic mixture on the chicken tastes very similar to Chino Bandido's Emerald Chicken (if you're familiar with that). Usually in Asia when you order this you get very few bones and big chunks of all white meat. This was not the case and a majority of pieces could be described as some bones trying not to look naked by covering up with cartilage and some meat. This was the final nail in the coffin as this was certainly less than half a pound and costs a HILARIOUS $15 dollars. By far and away the biggest rip off from a restaurant in recent memory and the fact that this dish alone costs the same amount as eating at Pacific Seafood buffet is quite the accomplishment in an exercise of separation from reality.\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed in the meal I got for about $43 after tax, then after tipping, it's basically $50 for 2 people. The portions were small, the food was mediocre, prices were extreme and the service was nothing to write home about. Atmosphere? Pretend you're eating in a white walled living room with some Chinese lanterns/fans hung about with 80s-90s chinese music in the background. Makes me feel like I'm eating at a Grandma's or something.\n\nThe kicker is the fact that each dish was so small for the price you paid, which makes you feel like a huge sucker. I at least expected the dishes to be big for the price, as in superior places like China King. Speaking of comparisons, I could've gorged myself at Pacific Seafood buffet for $15-16 per person and I would've come out on top over this place. Don't believe the hype and don't pay to try unless this place cleans up their act.

That was my experience with Miu's.  Literally the first thing that was brought to our table, the Dan Dan Noodle, was one of the BEST things I've ever eaten so it alone made me pretty much a convert. I was never a huge fan of chinese food in general so now I'm 100% positive I'll never have chinese anywhere else again. Because even though I'm not a fan of traditional american chinese food, I am a HUGE FAN of Miu's.\n\nThe second time I went with my Mom we had the Dan Dan and the Spicy Cucumbers.  FREAKING INCREDIBLE.  I don't know where they get their cucumbers. I don't care if it's a hydroponics lab located in that shady backroom they have, KEEP DOING IT.  The third time I went I had the Dan Dan Noodles, the Spicy Cucumbers, AND the Garlic Cucumbers, because that is how much I liked the Spicy Cucumbers, I wouldn't risk not getting it even if it meant just substituting another cucumber dish. Luckily, the garlic cucumbers were effing incredible as well (probably grown in the same lab). \n\nFor entrees I've had the Spicy Lamb Ribs, Chicken and Jalapeno (these are both similar in preparation and both amazing but VERY spicy. Like a delightful challenge), and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao is probably the only thing I wouldn't get again, just because while I'm sure their food quality and preparation standards are much higher than, say, Little Schezwan down the street, I can still get Kung Pao at Little Schezwan.  I cannot get spicy lamb ribs that make me want to cry from both heat and sheer pleasure at same time.  So I'll stick to the dishes that I don't recognize at Miu's.\n\nI will tell you that despite all my ravings about the food, I was A LITTLE hesitant of the 5th star due to the space. Yes I realize this is a chinese hole in the wall,  and trust me I do not normally deduct stars for places due to aesthetics (See: The Great Escape, Haji Baba, Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse) but there are some easily fixable things that can make the place a little more inviting.  Honestly this isn't an issue for me so much as I know it is for others (I once stayed at a sushi place despite seeing a cockroach because they gave me free sake bombers), but I swear to god if Miu's shuts down because too many people judge a book by its cover I will probably be depressed for like at least a week, so I hope they do make some improvements in that area.

This area (including surrounding buildings) seems like it could have previously been a deserted industrial or body shop district a few decades back, but residential/commercial development has moved in recently. Therefore, the restaurant is like an empty brick warehouse without a proper entrance or any windows. However, they have a powerful AC and the loading dock-style doors let some light in. The ambiance inside was very quiet, which was nice. It was pretty empty when we visited. Our server seemed a little underwhelmed and was very prompt with service. \n\nThe food was very good and matches some of the better traditional Chinese I've had in the area.

I found this place on here and was glad I did.\n\nAppearance:  It is on Apache east of the 101... enough said.  May have a Tempe address but that place is in Mesa if you ask me.\n\nMenu: massive menu, a bit overwhelming.  Did have the server help with some suggestions to help us decide.  Cutting that in half would still yield a ton of tasty options.\n\nFood:  We ordered potstickers, hot and sour soup, and shrimp w/ oyster mushrooms.  The potstickers were great, love the fresh green onion in them.  The mushroom and shrimp was very nice.  Very light but fresh and flavorful.  Hope you like ginger! (we do).  \n\nThe star for me is the hot and sour soup.  I always loved it back in NJ but out here it has always been very different.  Many places sub in regular mushrooms rather than use the fungus, and many add pork.  NOT HERE.  The soup was like I remember back east.  A slight gelatinous mouth feel, bamboo shoots, small strips of tofu, and that delicious fungi.  They knocked it out of the park.  It was the girlfriend and I and the small would have fed us both.  \n\nWhen it comes to ethnic food I allow a lot of leeway when it comes to the decor.  If you don't, steer clear.  But if you are just looking for Chinese food that isn't a chain, or isn't your typical delivery joint this will be a great option for you.  \n\nSuggestion:  Look through all the incredible pictures people put up.

The best thing about both experiences was walking in seeing all Chinese customers.  That is always a good sign.\n\nThe first time, they did not have a Canto chef yet, so we ordered all Szechuan and we were super impressed.  We love our food spicy, and they are certainly not afraid to spice their food!  The bean thread noodles in spicy/sour sauce is my favorite.  We left wanting to go back once they had a Cantonese chef on staff.\n\nFast forward to Labor Day weekend - we decided to go back and try their Cantonese dishes.  While their bean thread noodles were still awesome, I was extremely disappointed in their Cantonese dishes.  We may have just hit it on an off weekend, but to me, it seemed as though the Szechuan chef was just learning how to cook Canto style.  We ordered the Crispy Pan Fried noodles, Wor Wonton Soup, and although it's szechuan, the Mapo Tofu.\n\nLet me preface this by saying, I am Chinese, from a Chinese family, raised in the East Coast, many family style dinners in NYC with lazy susans, bad service, and sketchy locations.  I was also brought up cooking Cantonese.  So am I harsh on my ratings?  Probably.  But, some things I feel are just unacceptable.\n\nI couldn't call the Wor Wonton Soup wonton soup because there was probably only one whole wonton in the entire bowl.  Granted, a small soup was enough to feed three-four, it was mainly all broth with a bit of napa cabbage.  I make wonton soup a lot, and to me it seemed like they boiled the wontons way in advance or let them sit in the broth, thus they all fell apart.  The meat had all fallen out of their wonton wrappers and everything was just floating around.  There was nothing cohesive about this soup.  That's kind of a big deal.  Or possibly they did not take the time to actually fold and seal them correctly.  But the broth seemed cloudy and starchy which leads me to believe the wontons had been sitting in the broth for a long period of time.  Also - it was not worth the cost to order \"Wor\" wonton style because other than the above mentioned ingredients, there was maybe one slim piece of char-siu and chicken.  What makes Wor wonton special is the additional ingredients.\n\nOnto the Pan Fried Noodles (hong kong style).  This dish was confusing to me.  Were the noodles yellow? Yes.  Were they crispy?  Yes.  But that's about it.  The \"gravy\" did not taste like pan fried noodle gravy.  And, the dish was 90 percent peppers and onions, with a couple slices of Char Siu.  $11.95.  Not worth it.  PLUS, I have never had red and yellow peppers/onions on top of pan fried noodles.  Ever.  Again, another reason I think they were passing their Szechuan chef off as a Cantonese one.  Not worth the price.  I have no problem ordering this dish at even $14.95 if the gravy is good and the toppings are fresh and plentiful.  $11.95 for peppers and onions on top of noodles is not worth it in my opinion.\n\nLast, but not least, Mapo Tofu.  It was decent, but again, not a flavor profile I had ever experienced for this dish.  The first time we had eaten at Miu's, we had ordered the water boiled beef.  The Mapo Tofu had the same exact flavor as the water boiled beef sauce.  A very strong, almost over bearing flavor of anise and lemongrass.   Also missing was the ground pork, which is standard for Mapo.  It gives the dish flavor which it so badly needed.  $8.50 for a meager dish.\n\nOverall, we left feeling incredibly cheated and deceived.  Besides the high price point for substandard food and quality, the deception of trying to pass a chef off as Cantonese left a bad taste in our mouths.  It almost felt like they had run out of everything and were trying to skimp to make what they did have last.  We would've been happier if they had said \"don't order from the Cantonese menu\" so we would know that we shouldn't.\n\nThe reason for the two stars is A) I can't fault the service. The girls that helped us were extremely nice and accommodating.  Sure, you have to ask for everything, but, they at least brought you what you needed with a smile (not like in Chinatown where they throw your plates and utensils at you;) And B) their bean thread noodles are still something I would go back and order again.  $3.95 I believe (maybe $2.95) for a large bowl of glass noodles and spicy/sour sauce is still worth it in my book.", "business_id": "Az_IY3TgnOcnh1dXd7GZLg", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-09-03", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Han", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "kIIx6jPfdrwcb9Z1280R7w", "review_id": "a1_UdtuEy_j40xvMswPntw", "text": "The interior makes me feel like I am eating in a factory. \nFood was extremely oily.

She informed us that if we didn't want MSG in our food that they could cook it without MSG. So now we . Placed our order....... I ordered mushroom stir fry and green beans with garlic sauce my mate ordered shrimp with snow peas. The food arrived without to much delay. portion was ok actually, truth be told a lot better portion wise then some other restaurants. mushroom stir fry is two or three different kinds of mushrooms sliced with some bell peppers and dried chilli peppers, the green beans were fresh cut in half stir fried with green onion and dried chilli peppers. and my mates shrimp stir fried with green onions,dried chilli peppers and snow peas. Ok I quite liked the mushroom stir fry they only negative would be too oily, and I think they could have added some other veggies just to make it more exciting and healthy but over all it was tastey and it was not over cooked. the green beans with garlic sauce was over cooked. it would have been perfect if they did not cook it for as long as they did. other than that the taste was fine, especially liked the added chilli peppers. my friends shrimp with snow peas. He said it was a little too oily and too salty, other than that he said the flavor was fine. He enjoyed it . And I enjoyed my food. They would have got four stars if they had brown rice. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The waitress is very friendly and attentive.

Szechwan to be exact. Yeah, there's a lot of hype, I know. AZ Republic food critic put this on the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the valley. Plus tons of butt-kissing rave reviews. Actual restaurant itself does look sketchy and not a place you want to spend a lot of time in so I always get it to go. You need to be driving westbound on Apache Boulevard to enter the little driveway that leads to a dirt lot that you can park in while running in to get your food. Lately they hired some woman that can speak English almost like a native speaker so there's much less miscommunication over the phone than before. I call in my orders then race down to pick up the meal. I've tried a bunch of dishes by now. Stuff that was just okay: Dan Dan Noodles (\u84d1\u8863\u9ec4\u74dc), cumin flavored lamb (\u5b5c\u7136\u7f8a\u8089). Stuff that was adequate and good but not wow OMGWTFBBQ: mapo tofu (\u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150), fish flavor (Yu Xiang) Eggplant (\u9c7c\u9999\u8304\u5b50), stewed pork rib (\u7ea2\u70e7\u6392\u9aa8).

That \"smokers-block\" is really unpleasant because you also get the hipsters from the American Apparel next door smoking there too. The result is almost a fire hazard and I have seen the box actually on fire, at least twice!\n\nIn stark contrast to that is the Monkland location. Maybe it is that there are more children running around, or the fact that the cafe is located a few steps in from the sidewalk, but no one smokes here. Even in the summertime, the terrace doesn't end up filled with smokers choking out the customers who like to sit out there and enjoy the breeze. \n\nIn Westmount, the tables are often dirty.

On Monkland, a much busier location, especially on the weekends, the tables are constantly full, yet, somehow, they manage to always be clean. \n\nThe Westmount location is a lot more \"in and out\", in that they don't have the cozy setup Monkland does.

One of the items had been clearanced out, so she received less than half the price we paid back on a merchandise card. \n\nThis particular item had been purchased less than a week prior, so this really irritated me.  When we discovered the receipt between the car seat, I went back to Joann's and asked them to return the full amount of money.

I entered the store and went to the nearest cashier.  She looked at me blankly when I told her what I wanted to do, and referred me to an older lady named Jean.  Jean was very nice and said that she could help me out.  She proceeded to try to get the appropriate amount back to me by re-returning the item at the normal price, then having me pay back the clearance amount.  However, she screwed up and did not actually refund the normal price back to me (she said she was putting it on my gift card).  When I tried to explain that she was actually having me leave the store with LESS money than when I came in, she got upset and tried to tell me that I didn't understand the process that she was using.  I understood perfectly, and kept trying to explain to her how the balance on the gift card was LESS not more.  Finally, she got extremely frustrated with me (I was very polite, and kept thanking her for helping me out, and was never rude during the entire process) and went to talk to the manager.  The manager had her refund the clearance price back to me (which was put on a separate gift card).  So, I ended up leaving the store with the EXACT same amount of money as when I went in.  \n\nThis poor cashier just couldn't understand what I was saying, and wouldn't listen to me.

My dining partner the pasta with sausage, and we got a bruschetta and mushroom to start.\n\nAnyone who knows me (either on or off yelp!) will know I'm a foodie through and through, and should be used to the in-depth meal analysis by now. The rabbit really was delicious, served as a stew. With just the rabbit meat on the bone, and some peppers and onions in the stew, it was my ideal dinner - no additional rice, pasta or bread. Definitely my favourite thing from our meal.\n\nThe pasta was very...meh. Amore were potentially at a disadvantage as we had previously tasted an *amazing* Creole Sausage pie earlier that day which blew our socks off. So by comparison this was very...meh. I feel as though I could have whipped it up at home with a jar of Loyd Grossman and some sausage and penne. Not bad by any means.\n\nThe starters were tasty but again...nothing exceptional. The mushrooms were perhaps a little too creamy.\n\nIt was a brief dining affair, and whilst I enjoyed it, it perhaps didn't live up to the hype I'd heard about The Dogs restaurants. Admittedly, I am now a rabbit-fan and would happily eat that meal again, but as an Italian i'd expect the pasta dish to be far more Mamma Mia...y'know?\n\nAs Yelp have so aptly put it, it was A-OK in my books.", "business_id": "R2ir0q71ZgVdi4HJp6n2dw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-17", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Gemma", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "SQ93ximbtY5QoHruVHfdqg", "review_id": "VNLrpBjnpLBkVr_pSW2IlA", "text": "I was at the Yelp launch party in Underdogs on Friday evening and the food aromas wafting down from Amore were wonderful, I was very excited about returning there on Saturday night with more friends for dinner.\n\nOur party was made up of friends from Edinburgh, Canada, England and Ireland. We are in our mid-late 20's appreciate good food.\n\nI went on a date on Sat afternoon and it went so well :) I invited him to join us for dinner. Our table was booked for 11 people so I figured an extra one would make even numbers and just require an extra chair.\n\nWhen I arrived my friend told me she'd been waiting for us to arrive and was beckoned to our table with a yell of 'Oi, lass' by the waitress who it transpired was the Assistant Manager. It wasn't a good start, my friend has never been referred to as lass in her life.\n\nFrom the offset the Assistant Manager was unbelievably rude in the things she said to us, the tone she used and the general disdain she seemed to have at us being there. I appreciate it was a very busy night for them but the customers should never be exposed to their bad moods. We had no idea what her problem was  - we weren't drunk, were well dressed and are all professionals. There were constant instances of rudeness including - being made to feel like a huge burden for bringing a 12th diner. She said we should be 'put on a set menu but she would let us order what we want as long as we didn't all order pizza'. How generous... - When we asked for drinks she told us that she was going to have to go downstairs for certain kinds, we told her not to bother, clearly she didn't want to - Plates were slammed down onto our table when food was served - She was very rude about our payment being \u00a39 short. It was an innocent miscount that we quickly rectified. I wish we'd told her to remove the service charge instead - When I asked for cutlery I patronisingly had it pointed out to me that it was there... in a glass... halfway down the table. I'm not an idiot, I just usually find my cutlery next to my plate!\n\nThe food was beautiful however it was by far the worst service any of us had ever experienced  - quite an accomplishment with a group of 12! It was unwarranted, relentless and we were still talking about the bad experience the next day. Hardly anyone ordered starters and nobody ordered dessert because we wanted out of there asap. It's  shame that after such lovely food we left with a bad taste in our mouths due to one arrogant, inhospitable, tactless member of staff. I heard a couple at a nearby table making similar comments, clearly there wasn't much amore there that night!\n\nI felt embarrassed that our friends chose to go to a reputable Edinburgh restaurant and had such an unnacceptable time.\n.", "business_id": "R2ir0q71ZgVdi4HJp6n2dw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-01", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Susan", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "KC1R4iYR5AvKqEU9hSpmYA", "review_id": "7WNZNVPj-g5Z0_ABRgd0yg", "text": "I was part of the group of twelve with Gemma M in Amore Dogs last\nSaturday night. I was particularly upset about the whole experience as\nI had booked the restaurant having read positive reviews online and on the recommendation of a number of friends. As the majority of my group were only in Edinburgh for the weekend, I wanted them to enjoy a nice meal in a relaxed atmosphere. Our experience was unfortunately quite the opposite. \n\nOur group consisted of twelve young professionals and many of us, myself included, weren't drinking. The last minute addition of an extra person to our table seemed to cause quite an unnecessary stir and we were made feel extremely fortunate to be allowed order from the regular menu even though there was a restriction placed on the number of pizzas which could be ordered. We were seated at our\ntable for thirty minutes when having failed to get anybody's attention, I went up to the counter to politely ask that our food order be taken. Over half an hour after our order was taken, one of my friends enquired if our food would be out soon as some of us had ordered starters and she was informed that they didn't know how much longer our food would be. When our starters finally arrived, one of my friends didn't receive his order but he agreed to accept it when it arrived much later with the main courses. Another friend's main course didn't arrive due to a mistake made by the waiter but at least he received his pizza for free when he got it much later than everybody else. \n\nOn the whole the staff were friendly and helpful but there was a waitress with an Aussie accent who most certainly shouldn't be in the service industry. She seemed to have a real chip on her shoulder as her tone was most unpleasant throughout the evening . My friend, unaware that somebody else at the table had already requested that our water jugs be refilled, felt like she was back in school been scolded when she politely asked for more water. We felt like criminals when our payment was \u00a38 short even though it was an innocent mistake.\n\nEveryone agreed that the food was lovely and reasonably priced but the service certainly left a lot to be desired.

I tried a bite of the rigatoni and it was quite simple, but hearty, with a good meaty flavour.

My ice cream came with three massive balls of amaretto, coffee, and vanilla ice cream. All three were amazingly delicious, and so smooth and creamy.

A little confusing that the Italian branch of The Dogs restaurant chain has gone all American on us, but trust me, it is a good thing. \n\nAfter I saw Jurgen D's review proclaiming that it had gone \"all yanky\" I was curious! Then seeing their tweets about a PB&J Cheesecake (peanut butter and jelly cheesecake) even more so. So one Sunday I stopped by here for a lazy long Sunday linner (lunch and dinner, do you think it'll catch on?) at 5pm.\n\nIronically I went for one of the less-American themed things on the menu but my partner had the burger. The new menu still has the old Italian favourites of pizza and pasta, but there's now burgers, a larger grill menu with steaks and the desserts are American-tastic. The aforementioned cheesecake as well as chocolate brownie.\n\nThe ambience here is nice in a relaxed way. Huge tall ceilings and mainly white, white, white walls leave it feel very airy and open although it does get warm in a comfortable way. The waiters were all really friendly and prompt, despite that at the beginning of the evening there was only one guy one and it was busy at 5pm.\n\nThe only thing that I was a little put-down by is the presentation of the meals. Now, The Dogs provide good grub with slightly 'different' dishes (the regular The Dogs offers stuffed lamb's heart for example) but at affordable prices. However, as a result the presentation is just a little...lacking.\n\nFor example, the burger. It came as a burger. On a plate. That was it. Slap bang in the middle of the plate, one burger. No wee side pot of sauce, or a little side salad. And you need to order chips seperately. So that bumps up the price. The burger was, I think, around \u00a37 and add on chips for \u00a32 and that's \u00a310 for burger and chips. The verdict? Nice. But not the best he's had.\n\nAlso, my swordfish steak from the grill menu. Again, I had to order a side of rocket and tomato salad as the steak came as was. Now, I quite liked this at the time as I usually request NO chips if it does come with, and liked that I could add whatever side I wanted on. But the portion was really, really quite small. It said 8oz on the menu, but considering that there was a large piece of spine bone going down the middle of the swordfish steak it meant I didn't get much meat out of it. I'm a wee lass, and paid \u00a38 for something that left me wanting more...\n\nBecause, to be honest, the food was good. And I think if you'd ordered something different that was more filling naturally it would be good value for money. It was just my option.\n\nThe tiramisu for dessert was scrummy too. But again, it's just a slice of tiramisu in a bowl that's slightly too small for it (much in the same way that if you ate it everyday, your jeans would start to be just that tad too tight). If you expect good food but without the fuss of nice presentation, but rather how you'd serve it yourself at home, then you'll be a happy bunny.\n\nOverall, yep, thumbs up from me. It hit the spot. And we got to take our wine downstairs to Underdogs after to mull a bit longer. It's probably a good thing I didn't leave stuffed, the new menu is fun. The pizzas are also on the average-portion size (again a good thing) which I noticed from other diners.

Ended up going next door to Amore Dogs and hoping that it would be as good as we heard the Dogs was.\n\nThe design of the place is however not really that inviting so we were a bit hesitant upon entering. They have went mainly for white and made it very open which makes it feel a bit cold and at least not when we were there like a cozy place that one wants to have a meal in. We did however decide to go for it anyway.\n\nThe menu was a mix of Italian dishes and some American influences. Having difficulties deciding what to get we did share some of the starters between us.We tried two different salads and the some sliders (mini burgers). The salads were ok - nothing more nothing less. It would be the same stuff I would whip up in 5 minutes at home. That is perhaps not bad but would expect something more at a restaurant and the presentation of the food really looked like the just threw it all in a bowl and then served it.\n\nThe beef sliders were actually pretty good, some full beef taste and a nice sauce on it. The bread was however a bit dry and almost flavorless. The fish and pork ones were not great - I knew that I was eating something but it lacked all distinct flavors.\n\nWhen it came to the mains we all went for Italian dishes. I went for the mushroom risotto with truffle oil. The portion was really huge - I should have gone for the half-size as I did not even finish half. It was however not only due to size of the dish. This was actually pretty bad - no real truffle flavor or even scent. The risotto was partially over cooked and also partially not done. So a very disappointing dish. The others in the group had the seafood risotto, a similarly disappointing experience that was also drained in salt. One other person in the group had the pasta with chicken and that was ok but more in line with the salads i.e. something anyone would whip up at home at the same quality. The person most pleased in our group was the guy ordering the bacon & mushroom pizza - not the best pizza he had but still good.\n\nI have so far not mentioned the service but it was friendly but incredibly slow. It took forever before we could order, then we had to wait along time until our drinks came (nothing complicated to be made just beers and wine) and we had to walk up to the bar to get the water refilled at one point since it took so long for them to show interest in our (as well as the few other tables) table. It could perhaps have been understandable if it was full but there were only 4 tables occupied so appeared to be more laziness or a general lack of interest.\n\nMay still give the original the Dogs a chance next time in Edinburgh but I have no love for Amore Dogs so will not be returning here.", "business_id": "R2ir0q71ZgVdi4HJp6n2dw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}], "state": "EDH", "longitude": -3.1982534, "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 55.9544778, "attributes": {"Take-out": false, "Alcohol": "full_bar", "Noise Level": "average", "Parking": {"garage": false, "street": false, "lot": false, "valet": false}, "Delivery": false, "Attire": "casual", "Wheelchair Accessible": false, "Good For": {"dessert": false, "latenight": false, "lunch": false, "dinner": true, "brunch": false, "breakfast": false}, "Takes Reservations": true, "Ambience": {"romantic": false, "intimate": false, "classy": false, "upscale": false, "touristy": false, "trendy": false, "casual": false}, "Waiter Service": true, "Accepts Credit Cards": true, "Good for Kids": true, "Good For Groups": true, "Price Range": 1}, "type": "business", "categories": ["Restaurants", "Italian"]}, {"city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 5, "name": "Tahoe Garage Designs", "neighborhoods": [], "open": true, "business_id": "lc30P-jafzWzl93QOJI7qg", "full_address": "Phoenix, AZ 85003", "hours": {"Monday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}, "Tuesday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}, "Friday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}, "Wednesday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}, "Thursday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}, "Saturday": {"close": "19:00", "open": "07:00"}}, "reviews": [{"username": "Heidi", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "K926PVTa1g969OfFEUC5eQ", "review_id": "86Qo3d560ZkV4pxzDdrNtg", "text": "I called Tahoe garage design just to get a little information, I've been thinking about getting some kind of storage in there for years.

At first I was very skeptical, since my hairdresser kept checking her phone for text messages in between the cuts.

I have natural curly hair which is very hard to cut, since every curl usually does its own thing. \n\nSupposedly this place opened last August and she has been working there since then.

I'm a fan\" ... here's what I AM and AM NOT a fan of:\n\nI want to intro with this: I found a Groupon deal for $70 - partial highlights and a cut.  They honored the deal even though I didn't have the \"groupon\" - which is a bonus for them because they get the full payment in the end.  All I did was mention I found it when making my appointment and was informed to not worry about buying it.\n\nFAN OF:\n- As stated above, they honored the Groupon deal even though I didn't purchase it.\n- Gabby - she did a great job on my highlights and matched work I previously had done. She took her time to make sure the color application was perfect and was very clean when dying my hair.\n- Prices (even without the Groupon, partial highlights and a cut would have been $100... I'm used to paying $150+)\n- Plenty of parking\n- Offered soda, water, and magazines during my appointment\n\nNOT A FAN OF:\n- No receptionist (maybe just not on Sunday's or weekends??)! The stylists can not see when customers come in, so walk around the half wall/divider and find someone. Phone answering isn't fast either, the stylists have to do it all.\n- Broken lounge chair (it had a sign \"DO NO SIT\" but people did it anyway... chair should have been removed)\n- No street or shopping center sign (it's behind a bank on a back corner, had to drive around for about 5 minutes before I found it).\n- TV viewing choice (today was some poor action movie with cursing, there were kids in there!) \n\nOther notes\n- This place is obviously new and could use some work; it's only been around for a year. There isn't any decorating other than painted walls. Some shelves or bookcases would be nice as well, books and magazines are scattered all about. \n\nOverall, I liked the end result and that's what matters.

She left me there to bleach for over the time she said she'll leave it in, I heard her laughing in the back for an extra 15 minutes. She also left the bleached portion on sides of my face with the bleach on it. She let the water after soak me all over. The experience other than that was okay.\n\nI came home and showered, to notice a chunk of hair at the end was about two inches longer than the rest. I didn't go back, I just trimmed it slightly. Then my hair was coming out. I noticed the bleaching was blocky in each strand! There were parts that were still dark brown and others blonde. It looked like cheetah print.

Being from the east coast I guess we just have access to better deli products and no one I know gets excited by Boar's Head when we can have delicious italian imported meats and charcuterie.

It is huge, on a fresh bun, and there is a help yourself fix-ins bar (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle - nothing special, but the burger is so good, you don't want to drown it).  For $2 more, you can get two side dishes - cold salads, hot beans, fries, or chips.  The quality is excellent and the burger is really, really, tasty.  They also have bratwursts, pork, and chicken sandwiches.\n\nI'm also giving a 5 for the pizzas.  You wouldn't think AJ's was the go-to place for pizzas, but WOWZA.  They will custom make pretty much any standard pie, and they also have some gourmet ones available as well.  No matter what you choose, it is hand formed, brick oven baked, and don't even bother to order extra cheese as they are overly generous to begin with.  All fresh ingredients for toppings, and humongous pizzas.  You would be hard-pressed to eat 2 slices in one sitting.\n\nBut, the pastry has really slid in quality lately.  I think because they don't do a bustling business, they don't have the turnover that commands fresher pastry.\n\nAJ's is really the place to go if you need an unusual ingredient, as chances are they will have it, and if not, then they can order it.  The meat, seafood and poultry are all top quality, but you'll certainly pay for it.  AJ's isn't the place you go for your weekly food shopping (unless you have money to burn, then you won't care).\n\nThey also have a superb deli counter that has hot and cold items, and some really cool ones at that.  Potato pancakes,  chicken curry,turkey meatloaf, antipasto salad, etc.  They also always have hot entrees for lunch and dinner that you can buy a la carte, or with side dishes for a full meal.  Salmon, prime rib, those kinds of things.\n\nBut, this is also a cool place to hang and sit outside and eat and people watch, as it's North Scottsdale, and there's always something/someone interesting to look at.  lol", "business_id": "P8pJ2tUS-KnO8H4sbaAxTw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-05", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Maria", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "NKWVkiKMXdGGmIY9BmKKJg", "review_id": "tbDgA1peZU2vwo_JO7h1ZQ", "text": "Susan is GREAT!

Choose from meals such as Marinated T-Bone, Fresh Alaskan Salmon, Marinated Pork Loins (menu varies daily).

Large Wine Department w/Wine Specialist On Hand For Pairing Recommendations Or Special Orders... Their wine specialists are superior in job experience and expertise.\n4.  Artisanal Floral Department...  I have never seen any other floral department in any other grocery store compare to the arrangements at this AJ's.

I relied on the word of a staff member who, of course, is no longer with the company. The staff is misinformed (even the current staff, who advised me two days ago that a USPS change of address confirmation would suffice--only to be told by management when I provided such confirmation that that person was \"new\" and \"misunderstood the cancellation policy,\") and even though the Owner concedes this fact, he accepts no responsibility for it. [In case you are wondering, the contract, which has quite a different cancellation policy than what was sold to me by the staff member, is presented to you via touchscreen--extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to read--and the hard copy is only given to you after you sign and after you pay.] There are constant emails from staff advising of corrections to the now-reduced spinning schedule, problems with equipment not working properly, etc. The equipment is dirty even though during my visits there I saw very few people. This place is not even remotely worth the hassle, and frankly the fact that management induces students--people with little to no income like myself--to sign contracts that they cannot get out of makes me sick. Please spend your money with people who actually care about doing the right thing.\n\n11/13/15 Update: Here is my response to owner Kevin's comment below: \n\"Kevin, to confirm, I have already reached out. Here was part of your response: \n'I left you a detailed VM regarding the situation. Listen Michelle I know what you say you heard and what you were told but I don't believe my staff would tell you that a cell phone bill would work, especially when it lists out all of the accepted items on the contract. MIchelle if you tell ten people the same something and then ask them to recall it 6 months later, you will get 10 different answers, hence why we have paper contracts that don't require interpretation or memory. It is in large bold print that is underlined. I am sorry but you are going to be held to what you agreed to do per the contract.' \"\nInterestingly, I later called the gym, was told by a staff member that an address change confirmation would work, obtained such documentation & sent it to you, and received a call from Susan Simko advising that the staff member was \"new\" and \"made a mistake.\" So, you see, it IS possible that your staff misinform people. And it is nothing short of wrong that you hold students with little to no income to contracts based on misrepresentations made by your staff.\n\nAlso Kevin, I will be filing a complaint with the AG's office regarding Gold's (Arbor Creek) unethical practices. It's possible nothing will come of it, but hopefully by posting this, more people will be brave enough to complain. People like me have few resources to fight back (this is why you solicit students, right?), but I will use all available resources to protect my money.

Starbucks coffee is always the same, only reason I go back is consistency and customer service. This morning I ordered food (oven was broken and being worked on at the time; manager should have probably been there for this alone)...no problem so I ordered my usual coffee; albeit a very crowded morning I was not asked my name when I ordered. When the coffee came up (a kid named Andrew casually set a coffee on the counter and walked away into the back room without calling out anything at all, let alone a name which wasn't on the cup anyways; while others stood around wondering whose coffee this was). I asked for help and Kyle (who had a horrible attitude and explained he was very busy making coffee) told me to look at the cup and if that's what I ordered it was mine.  Wow, seriously?   Andrew and Kyle and the girl who took my order must have missed Starbucks policy's and procedures meeting or chose not to follow them this morning since there was not a manager around.  Worst customer service experience I have ever had and Kyle might be one of the rudest, most arrogant human beings that I have ever encountered and his only job is to make coffee and follow the Starbucks procedures with a good attitude and good service.

You walk into the establishment and pay for the buffet much like u would at any casino buffet.  You leave your tip at this point too. Not an issue for me, but what disgusted me was the cashier tried to short my server on the amount of the tip that I left!  I kept telling her she wrote the wrong amount on the slip and the cashier kept pretending to not understand me.

They do have a lady who makes a great pepperchini and feta mix from scratch that taste great.  The hot bar has mashed potatoes and rice.  There is \"prime riib\" swimming in warm juice and over-cooking it.   There was stuffed cabbage that taste like u can imagine stuffed cabbage tasting like.

We had gone to the crab leg buffet at Casino Arizona just the week before, so we were really coming here to compare. At first glance, I was very excited. It looked a lot more elegant than the one at Casino Arizona, and they actually had crab crackers and other crab utensils (I don't know what they're called)! (Casino Arizona only offered nut crackers, which are TERRIBLE for crab!) Their food selection was very small, however, and that was disappointing.\n\nMy first plate of crab was mostly water & hardly any meat, which was bland. That was very disappointing. I ended up getting some of their prime rib and mashed potato and it was pretty mediocre. I had almost given up until I went back and noticed the crab looked different (it was redder). So I gave the crab another shot - it tasted better, but still pretty mediocre. We then came up with the conclusion that perhaps the buffet was just inconsistent about their quality. We were right. We waited until we saw a new batch of crab legs that looked a very nice red color. That plate was delicious! In fact, perhaps even better than Casino Arizona's, but not by much. We also went back for prime rib again when it looked a little more medium rare. The prime rib was absolutely delicious, too. Unfortunately, there was not much to say about their dessert, or about any of their other items. Everything else was either mediocre or nasty.\n\nAll in all, the experience was pretty good. The quality of the food was good, but inconsistent. Their service was not too bad. but better than Casino Arizona's. I also think their price was like $1 cheaper? Unfortunately, because of the inconsistency with the quality of their food, as well as the lack in variety of buffet foods, I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. Casino Arizona's buffet is about the same, with a much more consistent quality, and also a much closer drive for us.

And this restaurant is CLEARLY an extension of said casino. \n\nLet's get to the point, the only reason your even considering coming here,*Drumroll*...\nALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS. Yes, its true, for $9.99 you can sit for hours and eat crab legs until you can't can move. IMO, that is the only reason to come to this restaurant or even the casino for that matter. The crab legs were plentiful and were pretty good, these are snow and not king crab legs so they require a bit of work for the amount of meat you get. I ate my weight in crab and did not dare to touch anything else offered in the buffet. The rest of the food (enchiladas, green beans, macaroni, etc.) looked deplorable. I get, Crab is expensive, and if they must give you something else to eat in addition to the crab its going to be the cheapest side dishes they can call \"food\". No thank you.  \n\nThe real question: Is all you can eat crab legs worth the visit? *sigh*, Kinda, not really. I don't regret making my 1st visit, but at the moment I'm not compelled to return. After I was stuffed to the gills with crab, and had to make the journey back to civilization, reality set in. The reality of having to drive 30 miles, 10 miles of that through surface streets, burn 1/8th  of a tank in gas, and walk thru a casino that is more like a smoky time portal to the Reagan era.. probably not worth it.

Basically you had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, garbanzo beans, cheese, and croutons.

Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience. \n\nParking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!\n\nI dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice. \n\nThe soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered. \n\nMy bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff. \n\nI had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved. \n\nDessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong. \n\nThe ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours. \n\nI suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.\n\nThe check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either. \n\nTo his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that \"the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished\". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.\n\nThis place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered. \n\nSorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience.", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-03-04", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Andrew", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "tiBMBRhBc1XBwb1oGe4GRA", "review_id": "8HRZznFT1tYXXjly45kB2Q", "text": "My mistake for eating 2 hours before going out to dinner here.

About everything you'd expect from a high-end restaurant. \nI have to start with a long-ish story that tells a lot about the place: \nWhen we were sitting at the bar, Shaq walked in and went to the VIP private room. (Tarbell knows how to show off his VIPs--the private room has a glass door looking out to the other tables.) Anyway, Shaq's publicist (I assume) was sitting next to me and my wife at the bar and was in a rather heated discussion with the restaurant manager. She wanted appetizers served right away to Shaq and the other guests (who were already seated in the private room,) so that he could get on with whatever other celebrity things he had to do that night. The manager refused, saying he didn't want to interfere with the flow of the meal by serving courses rushed or out of order. To me, refusing to cater to a celebrity to maintain the integrity of the meal is the sign of a truly great restaurant. \nAnyway, onto the meal. First off, a first-rate mojito at the bar. I mean REALLY good. Ambiance is very modern and upscale, dangerously close to \"see and be seen\" but not quite going over. \nThe food really was spectacular. A hand-pulled mozzarella dish (basically a caprese) with unbelievably fresh, rich cheese, sweet and fresh basil and tomato that was better than farmer's market heirlooms. Even the micro-greens on the side were nutty, fresh and delicious, without any of the bitterness you often get with sprouts. \nMy wife had a fennel and orange soup. Not ingredients you normally think of putting together and I was hesitant to even try it, but it was spectacular! Fresh, light and wonderfully blended, subtle flavors. I enjoyed a cioppino that was surprisingly delicate and loaded with tasty seafood. \nMy Cast Iron Pepper Steak was slightly disappointing. It had an overwhelming amount of pepper on it--really a pepper crust. This was easily remedied with a little scraping, so it wasn't too bad. The accompanying pan-creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes were incredibly rich and amazingly good. I actually enjoyed the sides more than the steak itself. My wife had a perfectly cooked Yellowfin tuna steak that was rich and wonderfully flavored on its own but the soy- mirin broth was somewhat overpowering for the delicate fish. \nWe shared a marscapone cheesecake for dessert that my wife said was the best she's ever had. It had an unusual rosemary-caramel sauce that really put it over the top. Just an amazing sauce. \nOverall a fantastic dining experience. Michael made the rounds to all the tables (not something you see as often anymore,) the atmosphere was comfortable and casual and even though they were very busy the staff was attentive and smoothly presented an excellent meal.

If you were lucky enough to get one of the stand alone tables, it might be ok, but we were sitting along the wall and it was way too cramped. \n\nWe had a couple of appetizers, both good. The caprese salad tasted good, but was not remarkable.

The creamed spinach was more of a saut\u00e9ed than creamed. I had the double cut pork chop. This was really good. It came with a couple of pierogi filled with bacon and cabbage. The last person in the group got the special, which was a NY strip roast. She asked for it medium rare, was told it might be closer to medium, to which she replied, \"nothing well done\".

Simply because you are  the newest crush of Martha Stewart and Oprah should not allow your reputation to act like a Van Buren streetwalker.

Very nice. And it was still busy at 8:30. Almost boisterous. We were happy. After a few minutes, servers presented us with chilled water and bread served with olive oil. The service was prompt on refills but not overbearing. Big point there. The bread was unremarkable as was the olive oil. Not very flavorful nor was the bread soft. But it was not bad. \n\nWe then order tuna tartare and and house pulled mozzarella (their name for Caprese salad). The salad would only be adequate for 2-3 people to share. However, it was delicious. Arugula, basil..well you know the rest. Very fresh, flavorful. The balsamic was amazing. The tuna was fresh but nearly flavorless. If I closed my eyes while eating it, I would have insisted that it was salty diced roma tomatoes via bruschetta. We also order a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. It was a good selection. \n\nK ordered the pan roasted chicken. We started chuckling over this decision as chicken does not have various temperature deviations like beef or fish. So if they pulled off chicken well, that is a good sign. L ordered the bass but we were informed approximately 10 minutes later that they were out. Our spunky waitress apologized profusely.  L ordered Salmon with crispy potato cake with molasses lime syrup. I asked for the cast-iron pepper steak served medium. \n\nK enjoyed his chicken. This is good news for Tarbells. L's fish and crispy potato cake were overwhelmed with the molasses and made the dish seem like more like dessert. Our waitress got L a new dish (3rd times the charm, right?). The manager came over and apologized. But she like it better than the first (or is it second) although it was a bit dry and missing flavor. My steak was 2/3 medium and 1/3 well-well done. It was quite peppercorny. Good cut, but the temp was off. And it could have used some more salt  from the chef so I would not have to salt it so. Perhaps it is my savory tongue that is too blame. It was not bad, just not great. The side potatoes of this dish were divine.\n\nThey comped our dessert, which was Warm Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream. The ice cream was still solid when we got it instead of melting into some sweet fugue. The ice cream was tasty with hints of a liquor. L told me she thought our dessert was comparable to Safeway. Although it was comped, it still failed to wow us.\n\nThe food was almost completely unremarkable. The service was great. I would take servers-in-training to show them what exceptional service is.

The servers, the bussers, the hostesses, everyone is nice. I can't stress that enough.\n\nWe were ridiculously excited to try the food, after hearing so much about it for so long. It was like the excitement you get when someone tells you they are taking you on vacation to the most beautiful place on earth but you don't know where. You know, when you just are awaiting something spectacular but you don't really know how spectacular?\n\nThe mussel appetizer was outrageous. There was a bowl of probably 50 of the biggest meatiest suckers I'd ever seen. Served with a garlic butter broth that I ordered more and more bread just to sop up... it was amazing. We went straight to the main courses afterward, which were much less appetizing to look at, and even more so to eat. I ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was served in three cubes, very similar to a tuna tartare appetizer. Served dusted in smokey paprika, it was almost as if I were eating paprika rather than fish. Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. The girlfriend's spaghetti and meatballs, something Tarbell's is known for we hear, were nothing more really than spaghetti and meatballs. Then again, what all can you do with spaghetti and meatballs that nobody else has done? The side of mac n' cheese was well, mac n' cheese. \n\nDesserts were somewhat a saving grace, but only moderately. I had the bread pudding and enjoyed it well enough. It was sitting in a very bourbony sauce and carried a great aroma and texture. \n\nAll in all, I'd say Tarbell's is serving two things... standard fare with higher quality ingredients (mac n' cheese, spaghetti and meatballs, bread pudding) along with experimental dishes that are hit or miss (ahi tuna, mussels) to overall garner a good but not great review from me. I'm sorry, but I just don't see it.

I had heard of this place as a foodie-favorite and I love supporting a local celeb-worthy chef.\n\nAfter a great cocktail at the bar (LOVE the atmosphere including the open kitchen -- very warm space with high energy), we sat and enjoyed the mussel app.  The size of this appetizer was disarmingly huge!  When the server brought out two large bowls, I was so confused that I asked if he had put in an order for each of us; the server kindly explained that it was just one order that he split for us (WOW).  I did not finish the app, partially because it was so huge and partially because it wasn't life-altering and I wanted to hold out for better flavors to come.\n\nI ordered the fish special (can't remember the fish name now, but it was a sea-bass like white fish) and my date ordered the peppersteak.  We did some splitting and switching on our entrees, and honestly...they were good -- totally solid.  ....but I felt bad for having such high expectations.  Solid wasn't what I was expecting...I was expecting impressive, surprising, can't-get-enough.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good; I wouldn't hesitate to go here for a business dinner or accept an invitation to go, but I won't be picking it in the near future.

I had heard great things about this place and being a bit of a foodie, I was excited about it. I began to worry because... well, you know when you build something up in your head and it doesn't live up to what you are expecting? Two months is a lot of anticipation!\n\nI was lucky enough to be seated with four other people that were big foodies too, which was perfect. We all loved food and, even better, we liked to share. Score! Still... would it live up to the hubbub? I've only watched Iron Chef a few times, but had no idea the chef had won it, quite honestly. Had I, I probably would have skipped the restaurant, honestly. I'm glad I didn't because this was one of those meals that I will remember for a good long time. One of the ladies at my table was also from Austin (where I'm from) and we are still working out how we can get Mr. Tarbell to move here (hey, if you're reading this, Mark, Austin is a super cool city... just sayin').\n\nWe tried many of the things on the menu, I'll share my favorites... \n\nFor the table we ordered the Brussels Sprouts as well as the Shisitho Peppers. I'm not a pepper fan, but those that liked them said they were well done. The sprouts were perfectly cooked and we managed to convert one person in our group that claimed they did NOT like them. Heh, apparently she loves them now. For salads, I tried a few, but my favorite was the beet salad. Absolutely must get this. It was amazing, the goat cheese was mild and the flavors blended beautifully. The house pulled mozzarella was also very good.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna (rare). OMG. I have had quite a bit of ahi in my life, but this was, easily, the best. It simply melted in your mouth. The nicoise on the side was a perfect compliment to bring out the flavor for the fish as well as the potatoes that were served on the side. I also got to enjoy some of the salmon (divine) and house-made ribbon pasta (absolutely wonderful). The stand out for me was definitely the ahi, but really adore tuna, if done correctly.\n\nWe also skipped dessert. Until we saw the menu. None of the four of us could decide on any one thing, so we each ordered something and then passed them around in circles. We got a few laughs, but hey, you only live once, right? I must say that the desserts were all simply amazing (and huge!). The stand out was the mascarpone cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce (Oh my, I wonder if my spouse would think it odd if I booked a trip back there JUST to get a slice of this cake - Psssst, the recipe is on their website though!). We also had the bread pudding, which I was leery of, but it was, again, absolutely amazingly well done. We had the apples (which I didn't get to try, I'm allergic, but everyone said they were so very good) and the profiteroles (which one of my table mates had a bit of a When Harry Met Sally moment over). *laugh*\n\nThe staff were attentive, answering our many questions. We never felt rushed and spent a good time talking and enjoying the company. The restaurant itself seems very unassuming in a small strip mall type of area. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a problem (we took a hotel shuttle). The place is a bit on the loud side, but nothing we needed to scream over. I would not hesitate to bring my husband or business folks here again. Though, definitely not a place for kids.\n\nThank you, Tarbell's, for a memorable evening of good food, good atmosphere and good fun.", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-02", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Khanh", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "YJyCUbX2cTLnwyJ0iC9g_A", "review_id": "fc7zYD5p5jHkaOWs0F2jdQ", "text": "Be still my beating heart!\n\nWhen I moved here almost four years ago...I was looking for a restaurant to host a very special occasion for 7 guests.

It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room, I knew this was the place.\n\nOn the day of the event, we had two vegetarians in our party and that was not a problem at all (I think their food was actually the best).  Instead of getting an entree, my son ordered three sides and he was completely happy w/his meal.  I recall having the raspberry mojitos and chocolate martini and both were sensational.  Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter, Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event.\n\nFrom beginning to end, our meals felt like it was taking us on a culinary adventure.  Service was also excellent and everyone in the party agreed that we'd come to a very special place indeed.\n\nI've been back to Tarbell's on a couple more occasions since then (always w/guests in tow) and the experience has always been the same...everyone leaves completely happy.

Crispy, a little cheesy, and just perfect.\n\nThe Tuscan Kale also had all of us a little skeptical, since kale is generally bitter. Not so with this delightful salad, I could eat it every day!\nFor the main course we ordered the Mr. Fish of the Moment (halibut), Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna and the Cast Iron-Seared Pepper Steak - ALL of these were absolutely perfect in temperature and flavor! \n\nDessert is a must, especially here! We split several desserts - \nMascarpone Cheesecake  with Rosemary Caramel Sauce (TO DIE FOR)\nProfiteroles with Vanilla Bean Gelato & Chocolate Sauce (AMAZING)\nSouthern Bread Pudding with Kentucky Bourbon Sauce\nThe \"Beloved\" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate (MY FAVORITE)\n\nI tried and loved them all!\n\nBottom line - this is now at the top of my favorites list.

The fresh mozzarella appetizer was described as \"delicious, but lacking pesto\".  I ordered the Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed the tangy glaze.  But OMG!!-- the crispy potato cake confused the hell out of me-- it tasted like burnt shoestring potato pieces.  Seriously. I expected crisp fritter or hash...something edible and not over-deep-fried.  Onto dessert.....I opted out, but the other 2 were given dessert with the restaurant week deal.  The mousse was terrific! (props to that) The doughnut holes were a letdown.  Like my potatoes, they where very overcooked.  In fact, one was ridiculously dark brown-- visibly over-fried.

So, of course I had high expectations going in.

Nathan was our waiter and he was awesome.  He was patient with both my husband and our friend Jared as they went back and forth on what they wanted to order quite a few times.  He suggested a great bottle of wine for us also.\n\nI was the only one at the table who didn't order off of the restaurant week menu.  I went with a Caesar salad to start, the Salmon entree, and carrot cake for dessert.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad despite the lack of anchovies (I happen to love anchovies).  The salmon was a huge hit -- I think everyone at the table had order envy over it -- but I did share!  It was grilled to perfection, topped with a local molasses/lime/honey glaze and served on a crispy potato cake.  The carrot cake was good but not amazing.\n\nThe restaurant week menu that everyone else ordered from had only one starter option: the pulled mozzarella.  However, I guess they ran out of it the night that we were there, so the manager came over and offered to substitute with other salad options.  This was a huge perk for everyone and much appreciated by our group.  Two people at our table had the Bolognese, but they said it was bland.  They were pleased with the other desserts (donuts and chocolate mousse).\n\nWhile I wasn't completely enamored with everything, our overall Tarbell's experience was a good one, and I definitely want to return to try more menu items in the future.

Yelpers raving about it, the place has all these awards, magazines are talking about it, there's an iron chef challenger/winner here, etc etc. With all the hype, I was a bit cautious, but still expecting to get my socks completely blown off. Was it a disappointment? I wouldn't go that far, the place is good. Service is awesome, food is high quality. But, it just isn't as great as what people will want you to think. \n\nLike most of my foodie adventures with friends, we all had a cocktail. They were all good, and we sampled a large selection. I don't think anything from this bar would disappoint. \n\nFor food, we started with the crispy white beans. Very different, and that's why we got them. I still don't have a solid opinion on them, but they're strangely addicting. Salty, oily, cheesy, thyme-y. Give 'em a try, at least you can say you did. We also had the onion straws with Tarbell's \"Secret Sauce.\" These are good, I'd recommend them for a group appetizer, but just nothing that spectacular.\n\nFor the entree, obviously I had to try the scotch beef. This was pretty good. The gravy was amazing. The beef itself, though, is just a roast. I've had the same thing a thousand times at home. My mom could rival Mr. Tarbell's famous scotch beef anyday with a slow cooked roast, and she's no iron chef. Still, it was good and I would get it again. Tender, juicy, flavorful. The potatoes it sat on were good, too, but really the special part is the gravy.\n\nOthers at the table had salmon and the house ribbon pasta. Salmon was good, nothing out of this world. The pasta was also not super impressive, just nice, good quality food.\n\nWe couldn't resist dessert and got the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. This was truly awesome. Creme brulee was also really quite good. \n\nThis review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the service and the atmosphere. This place really does a good job taking care of people. The server we had was amazing and all of the staff was super attentive. They know the menu, give good suggestions, and truly make you feel like a guest. This goes a long way nowadays in restaurants and in my opinion this alone gives them an extra star.\n\nSpeaking of stars, this place is really good. In no way does it deserve a 5-star review. 4 stars, sure, but they aren't getting it on food alone.", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-08", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Terry", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "w9r2bDWydh3HSwZBTlHOFQ", "review_id": "QHKsA7EdkkxtdrzzODKrdw", "text": "I ate everything including every last drip of sauce.

(His winning dessert from the show is on the menu.)\n\nI'm disappointed I wasn't completely wowed by the place, but the friendly and knowledgeable staff was definitely appreciated.\n\nThe restaurant's decor isn't particularly stunning. The tables do have linens on them, but the atmosphere was pretty plain, save for a few brightly colored paintings. The view outside is of a parking lot, so while the restaurant looks cool from the outside with its window walls, it's not fun to look at cars on cement while you're eating.\n\nThe crowd skewed older, middle-age and above. Besides a couple kids with families, I might have been the youngest person dining there, which seemed sort of weird. It's definitely a place I'd rather go when I'm middle-aged and have savings to spend, rather than head there now.\n\nFood-wise, I was impressed with the abundance of locally grown ingredients. That's a really great thing to have in a restaurant, so it was really respectable, but the food just wasn't spectacular like I had hoped.\n\nThe salad I started with, Maya's Field Greens ($9), had fennel, carrots and an amazing carrot vinaigrette (I left the beets off my salad.) It was really heavy on the greens (I sort of felt like a rabbit as I ate it), but because they tasted so fresh, it made up for the lack of diversity in the salad. And the dressing was so delicious, I would prefer it over ranch-and that's a big deal for me.\n\nFor my entree, I had housemade fettuccine, with a spinach pesto sauce, squash, caramelized onions and goat cheese ($19). While the sauce was great, and I really enjoyed the goat cheese flavor, I wasn't as enthused with the consistency of the pasta. The strips were so thin, it almost melted together. It was difficult to twirl on my fork and a little messy to eat. I did like the combination of so many flavors, though.\n\nWe also had crispy chickpeas ($4), which were very interesting. I prefer regular chickpeas to these crispy ones, but they were seasoned well with parmesan, olive oil and parsley and tasted even better when I added them to my pasta. I just wouldn't order them to eat them alone again.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal, besides the tasty bottle of red wine we had from the massive wine list, was the dessert. We had chocolate mousse ($9), which was thick and creamy and topped with tasty whipped cream.\n\nThe dessert wasn't enough to make me want to come back any time soon. I feel like I could get better farm-to-table food at chicer places for less money (see St. Francis). Maybe I'll try Tarbell's out again, but it probably won't be until I'm way older.", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Toby", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "sul0rJDvTT9QTMGiuA52WA", "review_id": "-ajXcCWLMa-CLQ0rOOtNYw", "text": "Everything I ate was slightly better than I expected.

To be honest, the waiter kind of ignored us a bit after this.\n\nThe employee that I'd returned my dinner to came back and apologized again. It turns out she was a manager, and she informed us that she was comping my dinner, as well as two deserts of our choice.\n\nThe deserts, by the way, were outstanding!

I say \"well, I'm pretty hungry, can we do something about that\" -- and only then does she bother to explain that the dining room is full but I could find myself a seat at the bar.  Gee thanks.  It was so unbelievably disrespectful and unwelcoming I'm pretty sure the only reason I actually sat down at the bar was because there was a seat open, and I was still trying to process what had just happened.\n\nTrying to put that behind me, the lady barkeep takes my drink order, and my food order:  carpaccio ($17) and the NY steak ($44).  The carpaccio was the most boring carpaccio I have ever had -- not bad, not good: boring.  Insanely, there was too much meat!  Just all meat and parmigiano -- a little more olive oil and some simple dressed greens would have made that dish so much better.  The steak I ordered medium-rare.  It came out medium, it was kinda charred, and really tough for \"35 day aged\" hand-picked angus prime -- more like the consistency of medium London broil from Safeway.  It had a sauce on it (which wasn't mentioned on the menu) that just looked and tasted like the most basic demi-glace sauce you could imagine -- at first I thought it was the steak bleeding off.  I don't eat potatoes, so I just asked for extra spinach.  Pan creamed?  Pfft -- I swear it was simply a pile of salted, wilted spinach -- it had no seasoning I could detect, much less any kind of cream or butter or anything.  It was so plain it was sticking to my teeth.\n\nI skipped dessert.\n\nFinal thoughts:  after some consideration, I still gave this place 2 stars.  If you're an older, much more boring person in the world, this place is right up your alley.  With all the Bentleys and Porsches parked out front (I saw some fogey driving a Viper!) this place would probably be perfect for older rich people that have no real palate:  people that go to restaurants to improve their socioeconomic standing among their peers instead of discovering mind-blowing food.\n\nI'm sure Chef Tarbell is an excellent chef, but I'm under the impression he has had to dumb down his food because the well-heeled, stodgy clientele wouldn't be able to appreciate the real thing.

I really wanted a NY strip, but it's served with creamed spinach, which I don't care for. Our waiter suggested subbing the sides from the chicken dish. I know that seems simple but some places don't substitute - I guess some chefs know better than the guests. Husband had scallops and said they were fabulous.

Sadly, my experience did not live up to the billing. As a solo diner, it was obvious I was pegged as a \"turn and burn\". I was quickly served  a tasty olive oil and bread for dipping, however the bread tasted very much like frozen par  baked bread, that had been reheated. I would have expected something a little more refined in such a restaurant. The server, who when I asked about the menu, what she liked, did not tell me about the specials I heard her recite at other tables around me. I ordered the carpaccio which came out in less than 3 minutes. Obviously plated ahead and kept in the fridge with which I have no problem per se, but the chilled meat subtle taste was masked by the very cold what was beautifully marbled beef. Add to that, the overpowering amount of vinaigrette dressing on what looked like pretty arugula and the carpaccio was almost indiscernible. \nOn the server's recommendation I ordered housemade ribbon noodles with homemade chicken fennel sausage, tomato, spinach in a rich buttery broth for my entree. What arrived was a very full bowl of broth that was very very rich with butter and for the first three spoonfuls was luxurious, but way too rich to be able to enjoy it in the quantity served. The fresh noodles that I had to search through the broth were stuck together in one mass under a small pile of canned tomatoes, the accompanying spinach also lost somewhere in the broth. The sausage looked like a breakfast pattie that had been browned on one side and then broken into pieces. Not what I was expecting. The fennel seed was so overpowering I could not eat it all.\nBecause of the reputation and rave on line reviews I will tell myself, maybe I made lesser menu selections and will, when I am in Phoenix later in the year go back and try again.

The bread obviously was store bought (my guess LaBrea) and had been sitting in a basket under the heat lamp. \nWife ordered his \"famous\" spaghetti and meatballs. While the meatballs were very good, the sauce was absolutely deplorable. I believe they use the pan drippings as the marinara sauce as it was extremely greasy, no taste and just simply a mess.\nI ordered the seafood chowder which at $25 is anything but seafood.  All they do is add a ton of butter and cream, sprinkle 4 mussels, and honestly tiny \"bits\" of seafood of salmon with corn, onion and that's about it.  Pathetic.

The Butternut Squash Soup was excellent. Our food choices included; Scallops (excellent), Salmon (good), Chicken(Excellent) and the Fresh Mozzarella plate. In addition, Wednesday brought us over a few other dishes (on the house) for us to sample. Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts.

Oh and the yellow beet salad was very pleasant departure from the typical salad.\n\nDesserts here are for sharing and while the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was OK, the Southern Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce was excellent!\n\nWhile we were eating Mark Tarbell did wander in and he made a point to visit every table and have a quick chat with all the diners that evening.

While perusing the menu we each ordered a gin martini; with a twist for me and dirty for my dad. They were both very good, but not outstanding. A group next to us ordered a variety of things on the appetizer menu and made the task of choosing one quite difficult, but we decided to go with the pommes frites. It's probably blasphemy to say that these reminded me of Steak and Shake fries, but they did, only 10x better. Somehow they are able to keep these thin fries piping hot for more than 2 minutes. We also shared the soup of the day, tomato bisque, and the bacon candy salad, both of which were delightful. For our entrees my Dad went with the Scotch beef and I picked salmon.

Being a 'simple' man, I don't care for most of the high-end restaurants that serve things I can't even pronounce, let alone have any interest in eating. So, a few of the things that attracted me to Tarbell's were that it's centrally located (most fine dining establishments are in Scottsdale) and seeing familiar food on the menu I would enjoy.\n\nI made reservations (to celebrate our anniversary and my wife's birthday.) Upon arriving, there was no available place to self-park, so I used the complimentary valet service. We were seated immediately upon arrival and, for a Saturday night, the place was not as busy as I expected it to be.\n\nI like that there is a TV showing sports over the bar area. Its situated so that those in the dining area don't really see the single TV - but its right there for those at the bar. \n\nThey started by serving us four warm mini French breads (each the size of a dinner roll, about the three slices each) with a ramekin of olive oil along with two glasses of ice water.\n\nWe ordered the mac and cheese as a starter and my wife got the pan-roasted chicken and I ordered the Margherita pizza. As you could guess, we aren't adventurous eaters and pan-roasted chicken is a simple and 'safe' dish. My wife enjoyed it, and it looked perfectly cooked. My Margherita pizza was amazing. I've eaten at places known for the their pizza and Tarbell's (who I didn't even know offered pizza until today) makes one of the best pizza's I've ever tasted! A flat-bread style crust, hand made mozzarella, fresh, full, un-cut basil leaves (the biggest and most flavorful basil I've ever tasted) and the pizza sauce was too good for words. I find most pizza makers use too much sugar or too much salt in their sauce. I am happy to report that Tarbell's pizza sauce tastes almost bitter by comparison. Its very hard to describe, but being a person who loves pizza, if I opened my own restaurant, this is the pizza I would make and serve! Even the cooking was perfect. A slight singe of burn along just the far edges of the crust! \n\nMac and cheese was also VERY good!\n\nFor dessert, I had the creme brule and my wife had the vanilla cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. A little bit of rosemary can go a long way, so my wife was concerned that the rosemary may be over-powering and the waiter offered to bring the cheesecake with the sauce on the side. Turns out, the sauce was just fine, but the cheesecake was very, very rich! Just a few bites and took the rest home for a few bites later! The creme brule' is served cold. This is the second restaurant that I've been to that does this. Only the top of the creme brule' is warm and the center is chilled. The best creme brule' I've ever had was on the 93rd floor of the Hancock Building in Chicago. There is a restaurant there (name eludes me at the moment) and I had a vanilla bean creme brule', served HOT, and it blew my mind! The creme brule' at Tarbell's seemed a little basic compared to everything else. It was good, but then I've never really had a *bad* creme brule', either.\n\nIt seems a lot of other reviewers were greeted by the owner. We did not see the owner around, but it would have been cool to meet him. Maybe next time...\n\nThey seem to employ a lot of people. They all dress in black and a couple of big guys just looked over the dining area, like they were the Secret Service or something! It was odd to feel like bodyguards are watching over you, but then when I got up to view some pictures on the wall of the owner with famous people, I rested my napkin on the table. When I returned, my napkin was neatly folded! When my Coke ran dry, within a minute or two, a waitress arrived with another! Fantastic service! I was concerned at first because the soda glasses are tall and thin, and when filled with ice, doesn't leave much room for soda. That means constantly running out, trying to find the waiter and have anxiety thinking about it. Not here!!! Everything is taken care of for you. I also like that the wait staff are not over-bearing - like when we ate at Fleming's Steakhouse and the darn wait staff would constantly be scraping our table with a crumb-scraper thing. It's just stupid and annoying. They don't do that here!!! Thank goodness!!\n\nMy wife had a glass of wine with dinner and I had a Coke. Our total, with tax, was $86 +$15 tip plus $3 tip for the valet when picking up the car.

This year my brother, who's a vegan, was not able to make it.  Therefore, I was looking for a place we could get a hearty cut of meat. I found Tarbell's on Yelp and saw the photos of that huge pork chop.  The photo, along with the favorable reviews led me to my decision to make reservations.  However, I was very disappointed that they no longer have the pork chop on the menu.  We had reservations at 8:30, but got there around 7:45 to have a drink and watch the Cal Poly basketball game. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable on their wines. He provided us with a sample of a Cab, which my dad later got with his meal.  While having a drink, the couple next to us was brought a beautiful dish of 5 huge diver scallops. My father and I decided that we would get an order of the scallops and a meat dish to split. We started with a salad that had uncooked butternut squash and fried parsnips. The butternut squash was surprisingly good. It was cut thin so it was not overly crunchy, as I had assumed uncooked butternut would be. The salad had a homemade parsnip vinagerette that was light refreshing and wonderful. The scallops were to die for, by far the best I have ever had. They came on top of mushroom risotto that was also excellent. Unfortunately though the Tar's Scotch Beef was pretty bland. The meat was under seasoned and not very good unless mixed with the mashed potatoes and red wine gravy to make it flavorful.

The seafood risotto was good, but a little too overwhelmed with the taste of salmon; but the Tar's Scotch Beef, and the house made Ribbon Pasta with Chicken Fennel Sausage were phenomenal; you can taste quality in every bite... yum!\n\nAnd lastly, of course I always save room for dessert, I was stuck between the Vanilla Cheesecake with Rosemary Carmel, and the Warm Chocolate Cake, BOTH WERE WONDERFUL! \n\nA genuine thank you to Tarbell's, and Nathan, for making this dinner such a fantastic experience. Dining is one of my favorite ways to explore the city, and I'm so glad to have made a last minute decision to enjoy my Thursday night at your restaurant. 5 stars.. without question!", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-07-16", "type": "review"}, {"username": "B", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "PWjZl79OFXAlnifrN0onDg", "review_id": "xTCvNHn0oeXmJYpzLemlIA", "text": "I have had business and personal meals here for years and I have never been disappointed.

Tarbell's was so incredible on so many levels. Not only was the food incredible but the service was outstanding as well.  My husband and I had never been here and were just wanting to try it out.  We ordered wine ( which was divine) the mac and cheese and salmon dish to share, and the kale salad.  We simply asked our server questions about the mixed vegetable dish , we decided to pass since the salmon was coming out on a bed of greens.  Much to our surprise she showed up with a complimentary plate of mixed veggies to try since it was our first time there .... and no surprise at this point but the vegetables were incredible as well.  Now usually I skip dessert (spare myself the added calories) but after learning that the owner studied culinary in Paris , i was inclined to try the \"wife salted popcorn creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e \" .  My husband and I just got back from our first trip to Paris and I have been searching for ANYTHING that even comes close to authentic french creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e ..... and THIS WAS IT !!!!!  Out of this world !! Worth every calorie lol !  Not to mention when looking at the dessert menu my husband was asking how the bread pudding compared to the br\u00fbl\u00e9e.... and low and behold they brought some complimentary bread pudding for us .... which was also mouth watering .  We most definetley will be back and often.  This is one of our new favorites !!! If you are on the fence about trying this place out ... please do! You won't be disappointed in the least !!!!", "business_id": "zG_wv69bsllw_PWhOmoAKQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2014-08-25", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Stefanie", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "weYmFWyt-Kyta8r9fZT9Xg", "review_id": "XryElJ6sFPCyD90QwXlpQg", "text": "We wanted to have a good place to have dinner with my son and his girlfriend.

With a somewhat smaller dining area as opposed to chain restaurants, this unique, upscale, fine dining establishment earns its keep on quality service to customers, not quantity of throughput.  It is a higher end restaurant, so if you expect that, then you won't get sticker shock.  Compared to other higher end fine dining, it's actually very reasonable with appetizers in the $20s and main courses in the $30s. We had a reservation through Yelp, so my table was ready when I arrived, which is always nice.  Also, there is valet parking service since the parking lot can be crowded, but I found a spot without a problem before I saw the valets.\n\nWe started our meal with the hamachi crudo appetizer, which was delicious! I don't know how they get such fresh fish in Arizona, but whatever they're doing is working! The service staff was very attentive and on their game, pulling plates as soon as we finished and bringing out the huge Diver Scallops next.  Again, it was absolutely scrumptious! My mouth is now watering just remembering how perfectly prepared it was. For the main course I enjoyed the delectable AZ honey glazed Scottish salmon with curried potato cake and a side of kale greens.  The salmon was perfectly prepared, and went very well with the sides and glaze.  The potato cake was delicious as well, but the kale really surprised me by how well prepared it was.  I wish I could get the chef's recipe because I've never been able to get kale to taste so good!  Finally, I finished the night with the apple puff pastry, which has flavors reminiscent of a country apple pie your grandma might have baked, but completely inside of a flaky pastry.\n\nIf you're looking for a classy, quiet restaurant with an amazing menu perfectly prepared and served to entertain an important client, take that special someone out, or just treat yourself, then look no further!

On my son's birthday, the three of us went to Southern Rail, and the next night, to celebrate my wife's birthday we went to Tarbell's. Both were good in the food department. I'm giving Tarbell's a lower rating because of the terrible service we had that night -- and because it compared so terribly with the service we had at Southern Rail the night before. The food was not bad -- in fact, when the owner came by we were enjoying a terrific appetizer of roasted beets and it seemed to indicate a great meal was coming up. But then, things began to deteriorate as the night went on. We had an early reservation (6:30) and things were fine till our waiter had larger tables on either side of us. While this guy was taking care of his larger checks, we were neglected to the point that we never received a birthday treat for my wife (which was absolutely huge at Southern Rail), and to the point where we actually had to get up and flag the guy down to get our bill. Really, just quite poor service. It appears after our Tarbell's experience that any restaurant, even one with good fare, needs to review how the wait staff deals with smaller tables when those guests are sandwiched in between larger groups. [Hey, Mark -- I spent $150, aren't I entitled to a waiter when I need one?] For my money, I'll take Southern Rail. While the environment is not as sophisticated, the large plates of delicious food were simply outstanding and our waiter cared a great deal about ensuring our satisfaction.

We'd heard (and read) really good things. We went on a Saturday night, and the restaurant was full. \n\nThe positives---the staff was really exceptional. They were super friendly and attentive. I also loved the roasted (deep fried?) chick peas that were on the table as a starter. They were super delicious. Also, our main proteins (husband had steak, I had the scallops) were cooked technically well and the presentation was very nice. My scallop plate was probably the prettiest plate of food I've been served. \n\nHowever, the flavors were just not that great. My entree lacked salt/savory flavors, and the root vegetables on my plate were not cooked long enough, so they were quite tough. My husband said his steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but the flavor just wasn't special or memorable. He ordered a side of brussels sprouts, which was actually his favorite part of the dinner. Overall, the food was just OK. I had expected the food to be 5 stars, but in reality, I've eaten at many many better restaurants.  Nothing about Tarbell's was memorable. The decor and the vibe was not cool or unique. The majority of the patrons were elderly. We definitely would not go back there.\n\nP.S.

Whole tomatoes are my least favorite vegetable (or fruit, whatever, shut up) I appreciated the gesture and the cheese mixture was quite good. \n\nSpinach dip: not actually a dip, like chips and dip, but I probably would have realized that if I actually read the menu. Its a puff filled with spinach and though unexpected was very good. \n\nBolognese: I only had a bite but it had good flavor, so I can't comment much more than that. \n\nSteak: they offer steaks either grilled or peppered. Should have gone with my gut and just gotten the grilled steak, but went on a limb for the peppered. I ordered medium rare; in my opinion it was slightly overcooked but I do like steaks quite rare so I didn't complain. The steak itself had great flavor, but delite what the server said it had a much stronger pepper flavor than I was expecting. \n\nIn addition to the entrees we had pomme frites (fries) and Brussels sprouts.\n\nThe fries were nothing special. They were fried potatoes, as expected. But you can get better fries at any fast food restaurant. \n\nSprouts: definitely overcooked. They looked almost completely black, basically no green left, little flavor left besides the charring. But, mixed with the sprouts were caramelized white onions which basically saved the dish. Cook them a few minutes less and they would be absolutely terrific. \n\nOverall, I give service 4 stars. Server was knowledgeable but could have been just a tad quicker with drink refills. The ambiance is great, and it may have just been timing but when we pulled up there were 2 Bentley's and a Rolls parked in front (good thing we borrowed the in laws' car so we fit in). \n\nI would return to try the non-peppered grilled steak or the lamb, but for my current visit I would have to give 3 out of 5.\n\nDefinitely give it a shot.

When I showed up to pick it up, the manager walked up and greeted me himself. He told me he was very happy that I came all the way there just for the cheesecake. He then discounted my order as an \"Early Christmas Present\". I was taken aback.\n\nThe cheesecake itself was amazing. They left the sauce on the side so it didn't get messy during travel. Consequently, I was to drizzle a little bit over each bite. The combination of the creamy cheesecake and the rich sauce was perfect. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n\nI'll definitely be eating at Tarbell's for more than just dessert in the future.

I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered a steak and buttermilk mashed potatoes.  After we finished the plated shared salad, our server surprised us with two magnificent appetizers.

On this night, we were celebrating the day we started dating and Valentines Day a tad early due to upcoming travel due to work. We both had made reservations here ! Ha! I had never been here, despite that just a few years ago I lived practically next door. I canceled my reservation , we kept his. We arrived and I immediately loved the decor which is what I thought it would be: upscale; classy clientele; white linen table cloths. This place was busy on a Thursday night! My tip: always make a reservation in advance! Our table was in the corner at the window and our server was Nathan. We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir from home and the Crispy Rock Shrimp. It was a super, generous portion of shrimp and was cut into bite sized morsels. The sauce had a bit of a citrusy asian taste to it. We loved this as a starter. I ordered the Scotch Beef for my entree; and the Caesar with Kale and Romaine to go with and for balance. My husband's first choice of entree was Tar's Beef Stroganoff with Gnocchi. He really wanted this , as he is a gnocchi king! Nathan, advised us that he thought they may be out of this entree and what would his second option be , in case? That was a bummer.. and would have been a nice point made at the beginning when Nathan discussed the menu with us. Scott said he would go with the Fish of the Moment, which was a lightly saut\u00e9ed sea bass. We didn't know what was showing up until it arrived! The salad was divine and very good. I could have made a meal of that alone. It was a generous portion and the kale wasn't too much as sometimes kale can be in salads. The dressing was just enough and not too heavy. The Scotch Beef... OMG.. to die for. It's like a delectable hunk of beef amassed delicious mashed potatoes, a velvety rich gravy and fresh cut green beans. This dish is rich, gluten free, generous in portion and so delicious. I took half of it home! Because it was our 'anniversary' to a degree and I had also let the restaurant know on MY reservation that my husband was celebrating a major milestone with his company, Nathan brought us the Cheesecake with Rosemary Caramel Sauce. I am not really one for cheesecakes , THIS is like NO other cheesecake I had ever had. It's perfect and round.. topped with this amazing, rich, and different caramel sauce with a hint of rosemary.. paired with the perfect Port.. Voila! Perfecto!

You know of the \"half season\" party they so promote and say is just so awesome was just about the lamest, unorganized, pathetic event I've ever seen.   The \"host bar\" Hazelwoods, was packed with tons of people, non kickball players, there was no where for our team to sit, much less stand.  We were told they weren't really even aware that we were having our mid season \"party\" there.  The \"specials\" that we were told about were simply the \"specials\" that Hazelwoods always has, so nothing special for AZ VALLEY league.  Then, we were supposed to get \"tickets\" for free drinks... But of course, you had to wait until 10pm to get them.  So, if you played at 7pm and were done at 8pm, you were supposed to sit around and wait until likely after 10pm to get your \"free drink ticket\".  I don't know about you guys, but some of us have to work on friday and don't want to sit around for a \"free drink\" until after 10.  Sure, we drank and stayed out, but NOT at Hazelwoods which was packed.\nThe start of our season was delayed by almost a full month because some other league had issues and had to use our field.  Then of course, we had two rain delays (ok, reasonable).  But a season that should have started in Sept and end in Dec. is still playing in FEBRUARY!  Folks, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.  This league is VERY unorganized, and for $70 and having to referee games, I will NOT be joining this league again.

Who knew this game would come back from our childhood and become so popular! You can drink on the fields, meet lots of cool new people, get a little exercise, and go to a local bar after the game to chat and hang with other league members. I'm heading into my 7th season and am so glad a friend turned me onto this! The games are at various parks, depending on which Division you choose. They give some discounts at the bar (light discount) after the game if you are with WAKA, and they have some parties mid and end of season. Also fundraisers for Charity, which I give a huge thumbs up to!\nNow, for the more negative aspects (dun dun dun!). It's 70 bucks per person, per season. Okay, not outrageous for a sports league, but basically this gets you a crap stiff t-shirt that fits awkwardly, washes badly, and usually rips. You have to ref the league games as well. For 70 bucks a pop we can't hire a few people to come and ref?? This can also alter some calls. Say someone is reffing who \"doesn't like you, or your team\"? What then you ask? Well, you'll get an inaccurate call. This is if the \"refs\" are even paying attention or know the guidelines and rules!\nKickball being a \"kid's game\" also rings true at times. IT'S KICKBALL people... Not the Olympics, World Series, etc. It's a social league meant for fun. Sure, it's fun to win and have some good plays and burn (while ingesting) calories, but it shouldn't be so negative and competitive at times. If that's your bag, go join a competitive league (WAKA has those), or play softball of something. Leave the big rubber ball to those wanting to have a fun evening. We even brought a friend whom we tried to \"recruit\" for WAKA, who came to one game and said it didn't look like \"fun\" at all, and why was everyone so \"serious and unfriendly while playing\"? Ouch. Not the reaction WAKA wants I'm sure... In addition to all of this, WAKA forces additional team members on to your team to fill them to max capacity. So if you are being fair, everyone basically gets to play half the innings and kick once or twice. 70 bucks for a half a game? \n5 stars for the pure awesomeness that is playing kickball as an adult, while drinking, enjoying being outside, meeting fun new people, and getting a little exercise.\n1 star for cost, having to ref, and negativity from some players. \nSo WAKA I give you a 3!

One of the great things about Edinburgh is the history and architechture allows for amazing buildings/venues like this. The venue is a serious of winding caves and vaults, which will probably lead you to get lost at some point. There is so much history related to this place that it really sets it apart from other venues.\n\nWe had our first night of Freshers Week here and it truely was outstanding. As students spending our first night away from home, with many of us new to Edinburgh's nightlife we were all amazed by this mysterious place. To me, bars were a plain room with a bar in the middle and some seats either side. Not underground caves! It really was a great introduction to Edinburgh. There is a real Gothic, mysterious feel to this place and it add that extra special touch to an event. \n\nThey cater for all types of events here including weddings, corporate events, private parties and gigs. \n\nThis venue really is unique and spectacular, if you are invited to an event here you simply must attend!", "business_id": "iVGkFUAyCfKVTEqU1xcqtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-06", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Anna", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "QYS29txRosYV2mGu68Cnhg", "review_id": "m0dBsNnFzwvDAD7kyOTKJg", "text": "If you are ever invited to go to the Caves- DO IT! \n\nIt usually is open for particular events, rather than everyday club nights and can host a variety of music tastes.

The upstairs bar and balcony is great to have a drink and chill and watch the people downstairs. The atmosphere is further enhanced by the cool lighting and the dark and heavy furniture and decoration, which anywhere else would look tacky but here it somehow works brilliantly.\n\nIt certainly has a lead as far as ambiance is concerned and it basically represents one of those clubs that totally sums up the city you are in- it represents what you expect to find from a secret Edinburgh.

I went to an end of year uni ball here, and it was absolutely excellent, from the great service to the quirky surroundings. It's not often you can say you've sat in the vaults underneath the Old Town and had a 3-course dinner and champagne reception one night, and the next time you're there be at  UV drum & bass club night!\n\nThere are two dancefloor areas downstairs, but what I love about it the most are all the little winding passages and nooks and crannies, where you'll stumble across cute little 6-person seating areas, or a balcony overlooking the dancefloor.\n\nBasically, if you haven't been already then you need to get yourself along at the next available opportunity.", "business_id": "iVGkFUAyCfKVTEqU1xcqtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-22", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Cheryl", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Yo6WTjxu9mnitbm4639owA", "review_id": "9CRH5b8Tx-zI560ezQQBxw", "text": "I really, really like The Caves.

The low lighting, arched cave ceilings and character laden interior make The Caves a fantastic place to dance, drink, and do dark deeds in dark corners (nothing too bad, maybe just a cheeky smooch). Anyway, the point is that hanging out in The Caves makes you feel very cool and underground, because, well...you are underground, but also because partying in a sultry lit cave with no view of the outside world makes you feel like you're part of something no one know about for a few hours. Parts of The Caves feel like you've gone back in time a few hundred years, or you're on a film set where something spooky is about to occur.

You feel like you're in a swanky bunker, or burrowing into a secret underground society, but whatever it feels like it's damn good.\n\nI saw a cracking show in here a few years back called \"24 Ways To Die\".

The show was two acoustic sets from Ziggy (from Found) and King Creosote (which in themselves deserve a review - amazing), with a panel session sandwiched in between.\n\nWith the lights dimmed, candles lining the brick walls, and a big projection of the Let's Get Lyrical sign emblazened onto the back wall, the atmosphere was perfect for the show. The room itself isn't huge, but also isn't tiny. It's at once intimate, yet still spacious and not too cramped. The audience could interact with the acts and panel without sitting on their laps.\n\nTucked up Niddry Street (so now you know where it is!) or rather, down Niddry Street, The Caves really are quite a hidden gem, but one I would definitely recommend going to if you get the chance.

Think Parisian bistro style outdoor seating, yellow accented table furnishings, subway tiled interior and a funky wooden branded bicycle out front.\n\nAlthough totally casual, the overall design of the place is fantastic (I know I know, I repeat myself), and I have to say that although it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it's definitely up there for Montreal. Plus the price/quality ratio is pretty darned good too (their pizza pie is cheaper than Bottega and dare I say even Magpie).\n\nThe wine list is short but good and decently priced, and the service was pretty solid as well. I tried 2 desserts, the tiramisu and a chocolate tart, and although the tart was \"meh\", the tiramisu was \"j*zz in my pants\" good.\n\nThe only thing is that the hostess who seats people is pretty rude and I once waiting in line for 40 minutes for them to tell me that there was a problem with the computer and that they couldn't take any orders (like a pen and paper does not exist).

We were in search of other food when we found Jac's down the street, accross Scottsdale Rd. I was surprised as it used to be Nello's and looking in, there were plently of empty tables. It was sprinkling and we were feeling adventurous so we decided to go in. \n\nThe interior was calm and warmly lit. something I like. There were the now obligitory flat screen TVs but thankfully they were on mute. There was also a piano in the dining room and even though I asked him to play a little something, unfortunaly he wouldn't! (cheap guy!)\n\nWe had the house White Zin which was good and came with an adjoining mini carafe, nice for only $5! We ordered and began to wait.... and wait... and WAIT!\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, our appetizer came. great crustini topped with the usual caprese suspects: fresh tomato, fresh basil, olive oil, balsamic vinagarette, but what made this pop was the melted fresh buffalo mozzerella cheese! Melty, sorta gummy and very yummy, it made me mad that I never thought of it before... yeah, some foodie! Never thought to melt the effing cheese! \n\nWe wolfed that down and talked a bit and waited paitently for our pizza. This resulted in another waiting game. There were three tables full... and about five people at the bar... what the HELL?! We waited  25-35 minutes for our pizza. Our server brought us some bread, which was appreciated but still... that's a bit of a wait. My guess is that they burnt it and had to remake it. The wait made them lose a star.\n\nBut when it finally hit the table... almost all was forgiven... almost! The blanco pizza with its mozzerella cheese, fresh basil, ricotta cheese and our requested sausage. Was simple and simply wonderful. It was gone in a heartbeat not just because we were starving (from all the waiting) but because it was so GOOD! it's so good I would order this pizza to go and cuddle up on the couch while watching a tearjerker all by myself... not because I don't want to cry infront of others... but because I don't want to share... THERE I said it! \n\nWe ended the meal with some tiramisu. It was creamy and coffee-y. I don't know if I'll have it again, I think I'll try another dessert next time. Over all, it was good. I'll go again, if I have spare time to waste or good company like I did this time. To my yelpers I say: if you're not willing to fight the lines at Grimaldi's give this place a go.

We started out with the bruschetta and pepperoni rolitos. The bruschetta was pretty tasty- proscuitto, black olives, melted mozzarella, with a balsamic drizzle. The only thing that would have made this bruschetta so much better would have been fresh tomatos instead of the side of warm marinara..which I thought was strange. The rolitos came with the same side of marinara and were pretty good, but you had to use the marinara or they were super dry. Ok, here's where they lost a star... before we got there, both of us looked at the menu online to have an idea of what we would get and since it was dad's birthday, he wanted a nice, special pasta dish. Welp, once we arrived, we notice the menu online was not the current menu. After we ask what the deal is, the server informs us that now, they are down to just pizza, paninis, 2 pasta dishes, and a few appetizers. My dad was hungry and did not want to go somewhere else so we just split 2 small pizzas. The pizza was TOTALLY different from the pictures online. A completely different crust and look. It was pretty good, but not out of the world. They charge an extra 1.98 a pizza for fresh mozzarella, which I thought was weird, but ok. To top things off, service was crap. I told the girl it was dad's bday and she still instantly brought the check after we got our pizzas. I had an empty water glass for about 10 minutes before I flagged her down and asked for a refil...she took the glass and never came back with it. Apparently, we weren't ordering dessert because the bill was on the table. She kept looking at the table so I am assuming she was trying to get out of there. She would have made at least an extra $10 on the bill by waiting to see if we wanted dessert. The only other strange thing is they were playing loud hard rock music... strange for an Italian joint. If I remember right, I think Disturbed was playing...which is def not something dad wants to listen to while eating pizza.", "business_id": "eRb0wjIVlj0bbfmePKZLng", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-13", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Halley", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "b4C9E7vTJrOdkJQA86xYSg", "review_id": "7VJ6LwFHmDC7MxFbPua1_w", "text": "I have come here a couple times now for lunch with co-workers.

the Stracciatella and Coconut particularly quite refined.", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-09-09", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Julie", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "bMz9lhjbTKuxXtrPOoEr8Q", "review_id": "z1yoZAL-EmKCPhU_0aJ3NQ", "text": "Stopped at the bar for drinks before being seated outside for dinner.

There's a pasta I saw another table order.

After soft openings, and 2 weeks of being open to the public, the servers and kitchen should have their issues ironed out by now.  We had dinner reservations at 7:30, and by 8:45 we were still waiting on our dinner salads and drink refills; dinner entrees showed up around 9:15.   When we arrived the main restaurant was not busy at all, nor was the bar (moderately) or outdoor patio area.  I'd say during our entire evening there, on a Saturday night, the entire place never was more than 1/2 full.  So being \"too busy\" couldn't have been the issue with the slow service.  Our servers were all very nice although we had to remind them to bring us drink refills, and our food various times throughout the evening.  It started off well, with drink orders and appetizers served right away, but then it just deteriorated.\n\nThe food however, wow!  We ordered the burrata plate and the arancini as appetizers and both were very flavorful and fresh.  The bolognese sauce that comes with the arancini reminded me so much of my mother's, very meaty, tangy, rich flavors.  Yummo!  My hubby and I both split a caesar salad, which was also quite good, but just your basic caesar salad.  My hubs ordered the seafood risotto as his main entree, and he said it was just \"ok\".  I had their Signature Pasta dish, with meatballs and I'm telling you it was amazing!  It's creamy, and everything wonderful that pasta a la vodka should be.  The only complaint is that, although it's supposed to be prepared table side, and provide you with a visual experience as the chef prepares the pasta and sauce inside a giant wheel of parmesan, my order was NOT prepared table side.  Even though, after we reminded the waiter we were still waiting on our main entrees, I was told the chef would be out shortly to prepare my signature dish.  No chef.  No table side fun.\n\nThe atmosphere in here is inviting, and nice.  There's niches where you don't feel like you're on top of your neighbors, and yet there's also areas where you're more out in the open.  The bar provides a nice area to sit and have a drink, chat and/or watch a game or two.  And the outdoor seating is adorable.\n\nIn all, we will definitely go back as the food and atmosphere redeemed the lack of faster service.  Not sure what the issue was, and I see from previous reviews service has been its main issue thus far.  Everyone was quite friendly, and apologized profusely for the slow service.  Now let's just see if they can get it rectified.

A short black lady was yelling at a server at the antipasti station to \"move\" so she could get in.  It wasn't like there was a fire or emergency.  She could have been more professional but I could hear her complaining about the \"mother-f***ker\" that he needs to move and she doesn't need a lesson on how to talk to people.  This is unacceptable behavior!!  She was in such a frenzy, pushing the two workers out of her way.  The two behind the bar appeared very uncomfortable and quite frankly I felt embarrassed for them.  Then a chef came out drilling the young man to \"go faster, faster...how long does it take to make this...give it to me now\".  Not sure what the young man was making but it looked like he was going pretty fast mixing the stuff in the bowl.  I proceeded to walk out but wanted to speak to a manager first.  The lady I was told was the manager appeared at the antipasti station and began demanding desserts and had that \"b1tch\" face when speaking to the two workers.

We were going to go across the street, but I checked out the menu of this place and decided to try it out and everyone else agreed too. I guess I remembered loving Red Rocks last Italian restaurant so I thought this place should be just as good. The place is really fancy. I guess I didn't really pay attention to the prices when I was checking this place out. We were a bit underdressed, but I thought that if this place is expensive their food must be good. This being Vegas, that's not always true. \n\nThe service was good, our glasses were always full and our waiter was nice and helpful. To start we got a big antipasto plate and I ordered the prosciutto with burrata cheese because I love burrata cheese. Some freshly baked sesame bread came to our table first. It was hot to the touch, the crust was a light brown and it was covered in sesame seeds. I tried a piece only because my Mom said it was really good. Their bread is fresh with a soft and light center. It went great with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our appetizers came fast which was to be expected because nothing was really cooked. The antipasto was alright. The parmesan cheese was served in huge hunks which made it weird to eat, like no one eats parmesan that way. It's too rich to eat in big chunks like that. The mozzarella balls were flavorless, needed some seasoning. The ricotta and basil wrapped in zucchini needed to be served a little warmer, cold ricotta is just really gritty and no good. The olives, prosciutto and peppers on the plate was good though. The burrata was watery and bland which was disappointing because I was looking forward to it. I liked the thick and sweet balsamic that was served with it though. It was tangy and sweet, great on the prosciutto and freshly baked bread. \n\nNext came salad which only a couple people ordered. I tried some of my Aunts caprese salad that was served kind of weird. The plate had only a few small tomatoes and a huge portion of mozzarella, not very balanced. She just gave me some of the cheese. It was kinda gross, I had trouble getting it down. First of all it looked weird, it had like small black specks in it, which is highly unusual. The cheese was spongy, soggy and flavorless, bleh. There is just something wrong with the cheese here, which is really sad considering it's an Italian place. \n\nOur final dish of the night and best dish of the night was their veal marsala. My Mom and I split it. It was plated very elegantly with edible flowers. It was a small portion, but it was split and we weren't too hungry so it was perfect for the both of us. The veal was delicate, yet had a good bite. The marsala was excellent with whole pieces of mini mushrooms. It was a bit on the salty side though. Needed some water after eating that dish. My Dad got the seafood risotto that he was very disappointed in. I tried it, the seafood was good, but the rice was undercooked. My Aunt got the salt baked branzino and was also disappointed in her fish, she said it was bland. I tried it and actually liked it, thought it was cooked very well, but I could see how it could get bland if that's all you had to eat. I felt kinda bad that not everyone was exactly happy with their meal because I chose the place. \n\n\nThis place was way to expensive for the food we got, it wasn't good enough, not worth it.

He made reservations for 7:00 pm, we arrived at the restaurant early by 10 minutes, and we were seated right away. \n\nThen we waited and waited and waited. It took a good ten minutes before we were greeted by our server with menus and glasses of water. Though, to be fair, our server was stuck with another table and talking to them. Except, to be even more fair, she was a bit on the slow side. \n\nWe ordered burrata & prosciutto, salmon carpaccio, and their salute caprese salad to start off. Yes, the boyfriend was really hungry so he decided to order three appetizers to share. As for our main entr\u00e9e, I got the table side salute signature pasta and my boyfriend got gnocchi alla sorentina.\n\nOur appetizers came out all at once. It flooded our table because we were at a two seat table. Let me tell you ... we looked like fatasses. \n\nThe burrata & prosciutto had a very nice presentation. The prosciutto was nicely piled up on once side, the cheese was nicely balled up next to it, the grilled bread was neatly placed like dominos, and the balsamic vinaigrette was in a little jar with a spoon. It was beautifully presented .. however, I feel like it was a mess to actually eat. If the grilled bread was in smaller pieces, that may be better. Other than that, it was a really nice dish. I couldn't really taste much in the cheese though. They put lemon zest on top of it so that was all I could taste. The prosciutto was really good. You could actually see them slicing the prosciutto when you walk into the restaurant. I loved the balsamic vinaigrette...it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the prosciutto's saltiness. \n\nThe salmon carpaccio was pretty much covered in lemon and tangy flavors. It was good but the tanginess can get overwhelming if you do not like that type of flavor. I LOVE tanginess so I did enjoy this dish. My boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't care for it all too much. You can still taste the fish underneath all of the tanginess but it isn't as prominent as some would like. \n\nThe salute caprese salad was already split for us, rather than serving it in one whole dish. The presentation looked really nice but a little different from how we normally see it. The cheese and the tomatoes were separate. They also sprinkled some pepper and salt onto the mozzarella, which is a little different. I sort of like this type of set up because I can control how much tomato to eat with my cheese or just gobble the cheese by itself. Hehe. However, the taste of their mozzarella is on the lighter side.\n\nNow, for their table side signature pasta! This one is a special one. They have a huge block of parmesan, wheel it to your table, pour vodka in it, and set it on fire to melt the cheese. I've had something similar except they don't set anything on fire .. but Salute will set it on fire! It was definitely a joy to be able to watch it happen. After they melt the cheese, they pour the pasta that's been cooked in the vodka sauce into the cheeeese and mix it. Afterwards, they serve it on the plate for you. Great entertainment value! As for the taste... I gotta be honest, it gets a little mundane after a while. I think if they added something else to it, it'd turn out better. Also, the pasta that they use is out of the normal. The fettuccine is wavy -- I'm guess they make the pasta in house. I had the urge to slurp it like ramen noodles because it was wavy haha. \n\nOverall, Salute is a nice place to dine in. It is a little awkward to me that it's sort of a fancy place inside a local casino. It just seems out of place to me. Not only that, the prices are a little on the high side. Then there was our slow server. Maybe it's just her haha. Bright note, if you gamble and have a players card, you can use your rewards points here!

I always try to give a new place about a month or so to work out all the bugs, bad servers, etc.  It was worth the wait, because it was fantastic!  We made reservations, so we were seated right away.  The service was fantastic.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The wine list is good and the wine is cheaper than most places.  As far as the food goes, we both had Caprese Salads, which were as good as I've ever had.  I had the Canneloni, which are really Manicotti.  Canneloni has meat in it, and this only had spinach and cheese.  It was a perfect portion, too.  My Dad had the rigatoni and he really enjoyed it, too.  And his portion was huge, so he has lunch for tomorrow as well.  I had coconut sorbetti and pistachio gelato for desert.  They serve it in a cone, but it is served in a stand, so it is more like eating it from a bowl, and it was excellent.  My only complaints is one that is a common theme for a lot of upscale restaurants these days, and that it is very hard to see the menu, because it is so dark.  The wait staff has mini lights if you need to see, but I wish people would think more about that when designing these places.  And my only other complaint is that the bread is nothing special.  It does not fit in with the rest of the meal, which was over the top good.  It was like they bought a bunch of loaves at a grocery store bakery and just warmed them up.  There was no butter or garlic or anything, just some oil & vinegar.  They could do a lot more in improving that, but overall, it was a great meal.  And I definitely look forward to eating there again.", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2015-11-06", "type": "review"}, {"username": "R", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "XVTkSgWZ4XwonKCc2_QM4A", "review_id": "LExKMsV0VpfIUBUdQjhJiA", "text": "Great dinner for our group of 30.

The location wasn't great, but since the restaurant wasn't busy, it was a fine, very small, table for two in the middle of the high traffic, area of the restaurant. (Later in the evening, 2 servers drove by in rented, handicapped scooters...I guess it was the evening's entertainment?!)\n\nOur server, Mike, was engaging and assisted us in making our selections. He assumed we wanted tap water but we ordered a big bottle of Pellegrino to start. We didn't order anything outrageously expensive or unique. We both wanted Caesar Salads ($10 each), to split the Seafood Risotto ($24), and 2 glassed of Sangiovese ($9 each).  \n\nThe salads arrived and they were perfectly sized and delicious. We had to ask for fresh, cracked pepper and the server who brought it didn't know how to adjust the coarseness of the pepper. No wine arrived. Mike came to the table and said, \"It looks like something is missing. Didn't you order wine?\" We reminded him of our selection and he said that the bartender was opening a new bottle. Fine. We enjoyed our salads. \n\nOur table was cleared and the entree arrived, split on 2 plates (very nice!). It was good. The Risotto was cooked nicely. The Calamari was tender and in perfect, bite-sized pieces. We each got 1 Shrimp, 2 small Clams and a few tiny Bay Scallops. The sauce was tasty but sparse. Still no wine.\n\nMike finally came to check on us and we mentioned the wine again. We promptly received 2 glasses. It was a nice wine but not sure that it was exactly what we ordered. We finished and Mike brought us our check. I was disappointed that the wine wasn't taken off the bill. I asked the hostess for Mike. He promptly came to the table. I diplomatically explained my displeasure and he quickly took care of taking the wine off the bill for us. \n\nWe tipped 20% in cash on the original amount because that's the right thing to do.

Made a reservation on Open Table and they easily accommodated us on a holiday weekend. Upon arrival our hostess was very friendly and gave us a nice booth big enough to accommodate four but there was only two of us. That was fine with me as I enjoy sitting in a roomy booth. The dining area is really pretty and calming. Although we did not sit at the bar, it looked like a place you could sit and enjoy a nice cocktail before dinner. We were greeted promptly by Brandon and he quickly brought us water and took our drink order. We viewed the menu and both of us ordered the gnocchi. This is a dish which I find to either be really good and or really bad. I enjoyed a mediocre caesars salad as side. As for the wine by the glass, what a let down!  I originally ordered a glass of Sangiovese, and my friend opted for a glass of Cabernet. When I tasted my wine, I immediately sent it back. I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of wine and this just didn't measure up to many other Sangiovese wines I have enjoyed in the past. Brandon was understanding and brought me a glass of the Cabernet. Once again, not real tasty but I drank it anyway. I understand that a lot of times when you order by the glass, the wines are usually not the greatest but their list is truly a disappointment. Ok, on to the food. My gnocchi was ok, a little too much sauce and not a lot of flair. My friend ordered the same dish so I have no additional opinion to offer on other dishes. We did order a sample plate of their desserts which came with biscotti cookies, sugared donuts in a nutella like sauce and a delicious sorbet.

In this case we were highly disappointed. \n\nLet's begin with the positives. The restaurant is beautiful but doesn't remotely feel Italian but it's very nicely laid out so walking in you're naturally optimistic. The service was great as well and as the food kept coming out it was pretty much one miss after another.\n\nWe started with the fried zucchini flowers that were bland & heavy, awful starter that set the mood. Before we were finished with them, out came our Caesar salads and it was the worse thing we tasted during this meal. The salad didn't taste like anything, it was as bland as it gets. Next came out the margherita pizza and again before we were finished with the salads which I couldn't even finish. The pizza was actually really good and is the only thing I would order again. The dough was airy & thin and everything paired very well. Lastly we had the signature pasta that comes out heated & tossed in a Parmesan wheel which was very cool to watch BUT what ended up being served to us unfortunately didn't taste great. Everything was one noted ~ bitter. The meatballs were bland and when the bill came at just over $80 it was hands down the worse $80 ever spent. \n\nBeyond disappointed & wont be back.", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2016-01-31", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Jessie", "votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "4e10m0_5X_EtFKGKqPw4nw", "review_id": "y3AsKCpnpOqo0Ch7MsQ7tA", "text": "Nothing special at all food is edible food chain kind of food  very  commercial by the book Americanized Italian food  I think the Olive Garden is better and that's about as bad as it gets I won't b back", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2016-02-03", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Dana", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, "user_id": "mI6mf62to_rRxgzrgX2InA", "review_id": "tdvejcX_ZHwDq0BkmcWUAg", "text": "Salute replaced the previous Italian restaurant at Red Rock Casino and is definitely an upgrade. The interior is nicely redone, creating a space that feels much more open and welcoming. They even have patio seating now, and an outdoor entrance that allows you to bypass the gross smoke cloud that lingers inside casinos.\n\nFor starters the person I was with ordered the chopped salad and I ordered the special of the beet salad. We both found them delicious and almost cleared our plates. For the main entree I ordered their special a la vodka fettuccini which is prepared tableside. What a presentation! Cooked in front of you inside a hollowed out Parmesan wheel, it is an innovative and new table side preparation I had never seen or come across before. Some of the Parmesan wheel melts into the pasta as it cooks giving it great flavor, and the fire gets hot when the vodka is added ;) I choose to add shrimp to the dish instead of the suggested meatballs and was not disappointed. My dining partner had the capellini which was good, but he found to lack a bit in flavor. He added some grated parmesan and red pepper flakes which seemed to suffice, but it isn't great when you have to add things to your food to make it flavorful, which is why it only gets 3 stars. The portions were good size as well, and we both ended up taking home our leftovers.\n\nLastly, the service was excellent. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful with questions about the menu. I especially enjoyed the sense of humor of the gentleman who made the pasta table side who was \"filling in for the authentic Italian guy dressed nicely who normally does this, but everyone has a night off.\" The wait staff gets 5 stars!", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2016-02-17", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Michael", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Pc3gjwTqjkZVF-_2M_FPsQ", "review_id": "yN-54RvEtmbnvBDqxBJgLw", "text": "I came here a few weeks ago for Their Family dinner promotion with my wife and kids.

First up is Salute.\n\nHere our party of four had dinner reservations, but arrived early and were delayed in getting seated.  Then there was another delay in receiving our menus.  Once they came, everything turned around, and we enjoyed a great Italian dining experience.  Caesar Salad was excellent with Creamy Parmesan Dressing and Focaccia Croutons.  Veal Marsala was fork-tender, and very colorful gooey and cheesy Eggplant Parmesan tasted as good as it looked.  Lasagna with Spinach Pasta, Tomato Sauce, and Bolognese Gravy was excellent, and crispy roasted Rosemary Potatoes with sea salt and Parmesan Cheese were hot and simply delicious.  A table mate's Baked Rigatoni Bolognese glistened from nicely melted cheese and was described as very good.  My entree-size Eggplant Parm was one of the best I have ever experienced, and because it is largely composed of a vegetable, one can feel less guilty about eating this cheesy but meatless concoction.\n\nFrom the time we ordered, service was spot on.  The chef himself brought my entree to the table.  The ambiance was sleek and modern, with all white dishes.  Rousing, thumping piped in music provided a pleasant backdrop.

We had a horrible experience as did other patrons there that night.  First it took a while to get our menus once we were seated, our water, our bread, some butter and finally a waiter to take our order.  Everything was just slow and the place was not that busy.  My friend's minestrone soup was awful.  He said it was very bland other than some hot spice flavor he couldn't place.  The \"broth\" was weak tomato water and it came with large pieces of soggy kale, a couple vegetables and some other pretty greens on top.  He only ate about 3 spoonfuls.  It took an hour to get our entrees.  During this time we witnessed two other tables simply get up and leave because this place just couldn't get the food out.  Also, three other tables were complaining to the waiters and the manager who didn't seem to have an explanation.  Once our food arrived my friend couldn't eat his chicken dish because it tasted like vinegar.  I ordered the lasagna of which I ate a third.  It was like eating a brick of cheese and there was very little meat sauce.  We complained to our waiter and he told us he wasn't sure what was going on.  When we asked for our bill, he simply told us not to worry about it.  I did have two glasses of the \"Anabella\" wine, which was excellent, but felt a bit sorry for him so we left him a tip and fled a bit hungry vowing never to return.  I don't know how a restaurant can fail operationally on so many levels and still be in business.  Maybe this night was a one-off, but they damaged any reputation they may have had and lost quite a few customers as well.", "business_id": "7iKl8h0j3GVSvni2yx2cJQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2016-04-20", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Ashan", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "Ygf9YYqmJXjiXU3dl50t_w", "review_id": "xpPE8vMZH9MiEjtBLzkDcg", "text": "Happy hour  menu is fantastic.

Then server came by and said no it's just a sesame seed bread but definitely not spur dough. Well turns out it was sour dough. So staff wasn't clear on what they were serving. To me this either shows lack of knowledge on wait staff or on management's part for not informing them properly. Secondly, I ordered the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese and pasta was in my opinion tough. My husband ordered Veal Marsala and veal was well over cooked. Not tender as described in other reviews. Maybe chef was having an off day not sure.

Terra rosa was a 5 star restaurant, each time I dined, food, service everything excellent. However when salute took over we tried it the very first month of its opening. That visit was a disaster.. Terrible food and slow slow service. The manager assured me of better experience and told me to give them a chance. We gave it another shot today, many months after and it barely moved up a star! We were told our food was delayed because the kitchen was backed up.. The restaurant was half empty, on a Saturday night of 4th July long weekend. Howerver the table next to us (who came after we did) got their food and drinks much faster than us. They have too many water and bread guys but few servers. Bread took forever. My husband ordered their signature pasta which is cooked table side in a giant 80 lbs Parmesan cheese block. The problem is, tossing that pasta in the cheese block, makes it COLD... So why am I paying $24 for cold penne ala vodka? I had the gnocchi, which was just ok, nothing spectacular to repeat. Wine selection is decent.

My plan was to purchase a couple more fish and fish food, but after speaking with this employee I decided to leave the store. I was trying to ask for advice on a newly setup tank which seemed to have some extra algae in it. It was not what he had to say that made me decide to write this review, but how he handled our conversation. I felt that his priorities were focused on other \"money\" customers, and that he would not let me finish my sentences before giving me his opinion. If he had taken the couple of minutes to give me some advice I had planned to purchase about $80 in products/ fish from the store. The last comment he made of \"whatever\" didn't help his case in caring for my business.

Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \"upscale\", \"boutiquey\" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.  \n\nAnyway, about the food:\n\n* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.\n\n* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.\n\n* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.\n\nI know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.\n\nI really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.\n\nAnyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle.", "business_id": "R1kKjAO5kZO6d0gQGqrvGA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-25", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Aaron", "votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "lu-jws5eBreAbJgVroatUw", "review_id": "odcnXSKemLL525ORE_OBbg", "text": "The location is convenient to my office and easy to get in and out of parking.

As I was waiting for my to-go order (quoted 5 - 7 minutes, took 10 - 15) I saw numerous patrons attempt to leave the same way they came in, which is where the line was.  The traffic pattern inside is very poorly designed.  \n\nI was greeted nicely by a cashier  that looks like she needs to remove her funky earring and get back into high school and get her diploma, but she was friendly and efficient, until she needed to count out the 46 cents in change.  Yes, some people still use cash.\n\nI ordered a mushroom-swiss SmashBurger for me and a Classic for my father.  I added on the sweet-potato fries and a shake.  \n\nSince the burgers took a while I had time to savor an outstanding milkshake.  Handmade & mixed, and it tastes of quality.  After I got back to my office, I tore into the burger, which was moist, jucy, and flavorful.  A really outstanding burger that befits the fast-casual restaurant.  Not as impressed with the sweet potato fries though - as my colleage Jason B. mentioned, it seems that they are trying to do too much with them.  \n\n2 burgers, a shake and side of fries was almost $20.

They have a few different varieties of burgers, all coming in either 1/3lb or 1/2lb versions.  You can also build your own using any combination of their available toppings.  \n\nHighlight of the entire meal for me :  Adding a fried egg on top of my burger.  My wife makes fun of me for it, but toss a fried egg on a burger, and I'm in heaven.  This place tosses a perfectly fried egg ontop of a delicious burger...fantastic.\n\nThe fries are quite tasty as well.  Our super-friendly cashier informed us that the fries are actually McDonalds' old french fry recipe, before they switched to canola oil, etc.  She says Smashburger bought the recipe/etc and now use it as their own.  Who knows if that's true, but it sure did taste true.  Delicious, crispy, salty...amazing.  Just like McD's used to make - you know, before they took out the trans fats, etc.  Maybe they aren't health food...but as a time-to-time indulgence, not so terrible.  They offer regular varieties with sea salt, or they have \"SmashFries\" with olive oil, rosemary, etc.  They also have Sweet Potato fries...  Hard to choose just one, as they are each great for their own reasons.  Honestly, I think the regular salted fries are my favorite, but not by much.\n\nWe tried the Smashchicken crispy too - not bad!  Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers, but it was quite tasty.  Not the highest quality cut of bird, but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good.  \n\nFinally...the milkshakes.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely quality.  The chocolate was smooth without being overpowering.  They also have a \"cactus vanilla\" which is a blend of vanilla and prickly pear.  I loved it.  Subtle prickly pear flavor with a good strong vanilla.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe prices aren't fast food low.

I also figured since the onion rings were small, I would also grab a fork while I was up at the beverage station.  Mind you, the place was full at this point. \n\nI stood up, took my purse, grabbed my drink and walked to the beverage station.  As I turned around, I saw one of the bus boys clearing my table. My burger wasnt even half eaten.  I started to go after him to leave my food, and he did not hear me.  He walked right by me with my dinner and continued on into the kitchen.  I was FURIOUS.  I had just paid $10 for a full meal, and this kid was taking it away.  (it was half the burger and half the fries, not the whole burger.)\n\nWhile he walked into the kitchen, I grabbed one of the burger girls and told her what was going on.  I explained that I had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and I wasnt done.  She told me to hold on a second, and grabbed the kid (who appeared to be in high school) and told me to tell him what I had told her.  I explained to him that I was NOT DONE EATING and he had taken away the rest of my dinner.  He apologized, as did the server.  I was still upset, and told him I didnt want an apology, I wanted the the rest of my dinner!\n\nThey offered to cook me up another burger and fries.  I decided to pass, as I was mostly full from what I had already eaten.  I asked them to get the manager and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out.  I wanted them to know what had happened, so that way they would know.\n\nI left and called the store when I got home and talked to the manager. I explained that I was upset, as anyone would be, and had wanted to talk to her about it in person, but the kid who went to get the manager never reappeared. It was upsetting for me all the way around.\n\nThe manager apologized and took my name and number.   They said that if I come in, I can have a gift certificate for a free meal there, which is what I had wanted in the first place.\n\nAnyways, even though I love the food here, I dont know that I will be back to this specific location any time soon, due to this whole thing.", "business_id": "R1kKjAO5kZO6d0gQGqrvGA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-12", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Emily", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "fxiCgoph0sakobXY9ZKFqQ", "review_id": "Aeju3LlbPvp-AOs_fCoMjg", "text": "I really hoped this place would be better.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the food--everything else I can forgive.

The location is clean and very contemporary, but it still had a 50's burger joint feel. I liked it.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Sin City burger, since it was the guest of honor. I got the 1/3 lb (there was a 1/2 lb available too) and it was stacked with sauteed onions, thick cut apple wood bacon, a fried egg and then their shoestring onion rings on top of a golden kaiser roll. Holy crap, the 1/3 was huge! I couldn't imagine the 1/2 pounder. I could only eat half (which of course made my husband happy). Anyway...it was good! I was curious about the fried egg aspect, but it was like breakfast on a burger. Burgers good. Breakfast good. My only thing was it was a tad salty for my taste, but luckily for me they had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter available with a frosted cold mug. :) :) :)\n\nWe also ordered the rosemary fries and the shoestring onion rings on the side. I was a fan of the fries...I loves me some rosemary. They were cooked to crispy yet mealy perfection. The onion rings were okay. I liked them better on top of the burger as opposed to the side. Would like to try their sweet potato fries next time.\n\nWe were also given the Cactus Vanilla milk shake to try. Again very good, I had no complaints, I just wasn't sure I tasted the cactus.

However, instead of that kind of crowd it was mostly middle-aged couples, obviously out on a weekend excursion to the nearby Lowe's, each with 2+ kids in tow. \n\nHowever much I do enjoy trendiness, I think the food is still the most important aspect of a restaurant. And I did not enjoy my burger half as much as I thought I would. I don't mind the fact that it is smashed thin and overcooked - I like them very well done. But it was so greasy, it just really didn't have a good flavor at all. And the chipotle bun tasted like a regular white bread to me, I did not get any spiciness from it at all. I love sweet potato fries but these were inconsistently cooked. Some were burnt and saw were almost raw. The chocolate shake was just ok.

Before I continue this review, I need to throw out the disclaimer that I have difficulty ripping friendly people.  SmashBurger was very friendly.\n\nExperience starts by walking into an utterly confusing design with no one behind the counter, no one to be found.  I stare at the menu plastered above the cash register for 3 whole minutes before the girl working the counter arrives. I have no idea that everything is a la carte, I am college educated, and  I am betting this is not a reflection of my intelligence.\n\nThe girl working the counter (no name tag) is incredibly friendly, and apparently quite stressed over the very limited supply of customers in the restaurant.  I order \"The Classic Combo\" and am quickly informed that no such item exists in SmashBurger.  Obviously the girl working here has limited fast food experience because she proceeds to ask me item by item what I want.  We narrow it down, after some discussion, to a hamburger, fries, a drink.  Add chili.. what the hell.  I just drove 309 miles, lets splurge!!  Price is circa $10.50.  A bit stiff, but hey if the food is good, no biggy...\n\nI get a plastic cup (noteworthy because this is the machine washable style, not the to go style) then take my seat at a table covered in filth.  This is the cleanest table I could find, however.  I am certainly not ADD, but I made 3 trips to the soda dispenser to wet napkins with water to wipe down the table.  I am being watched by employees the entire time.\n\nFood arrives:  Burger looks pretty friggen awesome!  Chili is in a cup, coated in cheese.  No fries.  Long story short, she did not add fries to my order, extra $2.18.  Meal grand total now circa $13.  A bit high for a hamburger.  You aren't Ruth Chris.  After more discussion, I get fries ordered, they show up about 5 minutes later. \n\nThe food:\n\nChili:  I love chili.  It will be the death of me.  This chili was very watery (I know, I should not have eaten it.  Everything in the last paragraph is my fault) and as the copious amounts of cheese melted it became very greasy.  I added a spoonful of chili to my hamburger and sampled the chili a few times until I realized my GI tract was preparing for war with me.\n\nHamburger: Excellent flavor.  Good job here.  Hard to mess this up, however, and not worth $10.  With the fluid drained chili that I put on it, it was pretty solid.  I may actually crave this item.\n\nBetter late than never French Fries:  Stiff, stale, no flavor.  I tried to dip them in chili for flavor, but it was watery to the point that they only came out brown, no real meat to them.  Doused in ketchup and salt, slightly tolerable.  Will not take this add on next time.\n\nService:  Very friendly.  The flighty girl working the counter was also apparently the server and expeditor.  Maybe they were short staffed today.  If not, horrible business plan.  When she is trying to get food out and to tables, people ordering are waiting. Likewise, when I can clearly see my food is ready and I am starving, I am waiting for an indecisive idiot to order.  This DOES NOT WORK!  \n\nWill I be back?  Probably not.  Do I hate them and would I steer you away?  Not really.  They have decent food but....  they lack value and need operational help.  In the end, the only thing SmashBurger smashed was my colon.

The entrance and exits are completely out of whack.  Get rid of the wall that is directly in front of the door when you enter, please!!   The place needs to be redesigned, excepting the back half of the restaurant is  not changeable by any restaurant standards, it's narrow, dark and not a good eating atmosphere.  If nothing else, they need to change the lighting in the place and give it a MUCH different ambiance.  \nBut let's get past that and get to the food (still, the setup of a restaurant can greatly increase or decrease your appetite and your enjoyment of the food you are eating). \n\nBurgers and fries, they go hand in hand. You don't really have one without the other.\nSo, the fries are also pretty bad.  Unbelievably greasy.  To the point the grease drips off the fries and into the bottom of the cup they are served in and pooling.  Fingers covered with grease.  The fries are skinny and short. I don't mind the skinny part, I do mind the short part.  Hard to dip into ketchup.  I was in the semi trying to just eat the fries and constantly using a napkin to get the grease off of my fingers.  \n\nI ordered an Arizona burger. Now I'm going into the positive mode. That thing was awesome.  I don't know what kind of bun that is, but it's very good.  The burger was a perfect blend of various ingredients and it was delicious.  If the burger hadn't been as  good as it is, I would have given this place a 2 star rating.  I did have them add grilled onions to mine, but even without them it still would have been a very good burger.  \n\nThat's it.

This location SUCKS.\n\nI went for lunch with someone who has never had Smashburger before. I wish I had been paying attention when he ordered because he ended up getting a pretty plain burger, no fixins. He said he assumed they came with lettuce, tomato, etc. and that the girl at the register did not ask what he wanted on it.\n\nSecond problem, the ice was being filled in the beverage dispenser and some genius employee unplugged the machine first and decided to not tell anyone, not even the girl filling the ice! Several customers asked staff what was up with the drinks, but nobody investigated the problem until I made sure someone understood, \"The beverage machine does not seem to be ON.\" Took a lot of head-scratching before Mr. Genius came out and said, \"Oh! I unplugged it! Haha...\". This whole fiasco led to about 20 customers needing drinks all at the same time.\n\nTHIRD and possibly the most inexcusable problem. My fries... were SWIMMING in oil. I was able to eat most of them, but there were quite a few that were inedible. I will post a picture. It was really gross. You can clearly see the oil slick on the fries, what's harder to see is the POOL underneath them, but it was definitely there. What kind of half-assed, lazy fry-cook allows this to happen?

That being said, I think it's pretty clear that I enjoy a good smash.\n\nThe burger itself is good, you can tell that the meat is of decent quality and it tastes good to boot. Maybe a little more seasoning to really make the flavor pop, but that's just my opinion. What really makes Smash that much better is the various toppings that go on the burger. There are so many different options that there's bound to be a combination that you're going to enjoy. The toppings are also really good. Now I know that it sounds a little strange to be praising the toppings more than what should be the star of a burger, but in all honesty, that's how it rolls here, they really change the dynamic of what essentially a naked burger.\n\nOh, and the sides, kinda hit and miss. The Smash fries, I personally feel are a little overrated. I like my fries to have a saltiness factor in them, and with their signature smash fries, it just wasn't there. The flavor was alright, don't get me wrong, but the parmesan and rosemary flavors didn't do it for me. Now the fried pickles and veggie fries? That's where it's at. The pickles may have been a little on the salty side (even for me), but they were packed with flavor, and were really delicious. The flash fried veggies were also a real treat. Who knew that plopping raw veggies in a fryer for a few seconds would make them amazing?\n\nAll in all, Smashburger is a darn tasty place to get a burger.

The restaurant is on the small side, but has a great energetic vibe with a casual, warm decor and fab tunes in the background. What can I say? Both the food and service is amazing! The wait staff are very friendly and attentive, and our waitress made some great wine recommendations.  In terms of the food.... DEE-LICIOUS!  My date and I had:\n\n- Marinated vegetables (Red bell pepper, mushrooms and something else I can't remember. Very flavourful without being 'vinegary').\n\n- Polenta, taleggio and figs (Very good - you could really taste the figs, but the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The polenta had a lovely texture).\n\n- Lobster & fennel cannellonis (My favorite dish! I could eat this alone and feel quite content, lol.  The lobster filling is generous, and I think there are apples as well - I'm not 100% sure, but there is a slight crunchy sweetness that really meshed well with the lobster. To die for!).\n\n- Lasagna (Pork confit, pistachios and apple - simply amazing. This is one of their new dishes and it's not on their online menu so I can't provide the exact ingredients). \n\n- Pizzette (Bianca with fontina, potatoes and rosemary - not at all heavy as the potatoes are thinly sliced. The pizza dough reminds me of naan - delicious!).\n\n- Lamb meatballs (I'm generally not a fan of lamb or meat, but these meatballs were fabulous! Served in a light and tasty tomato sauce). \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu Bianco and the Lime Panacotta. My favorite was the tiramisu - the panacotta was nice, but I found it to be lacking in flavour.\n\nUPDATED: You must try to homemade porchetta! It's absolutely delicious and literally melts in your mouth. That's quite a compliment coming from me - I generally don't eat meat, like... EVER! =-)\n\n\nAll of the dishes are prepared with fresh ingredients and served in small portions that are meant to be shared. I really love this concept because it allows you to try different things, without filling up.  I think the only down side was that some of the dishes arrived at the same time, and by the time we got to them, they had cooled down a bit.

Not so at Dolcetto and co. This bright and friendly wine bar in the Old Port brings a refreshingly light take on traditional Italian fare with a tapas style tempo. At Dolcetto, the focus is on delicious food and drink with a casual upbeat atmosphere. It is a great destination for an afterwork glass of wine with a co-worker or a casual date, but it can also accommodate larger groups of a dozen or so at the communal family style table.\n\nWhat's Really Good: \nWith all the crazy Japanese/French fusion taco emulsion foodwizardry we've been seeing around, family-style Italian comfort food is not the most exotic cuisine we have come across recently. That certainly does not mean we are past the point of simple pleasures. At Dolcetto they specialize in taking your expectations and then surpassing them with quality ingredients and flawless execution. For example, the lobster cannelloni and the truffle cream gnocchi manage a delicate balancing act between incredibly rich ingredients and a rather light final product.\nAnd you can't go wrong with the pizzas. Whether you take the traditional route with the classic margherita or go for something less typical like the salmon tartar pizza, we promise your taste buds will be satisfied. If you're just looking for a succulent snack to go with a nice glass of wine the cheeses and charcuterie are the way to go. The porchetta is prepared in-house and hits delicious savoury notes of rosemary and orange zest, whereas the boschetto al tartufo served with a golden drizzle of truffle infused honey makes for a fantastic dessert cheese.\n\nYou'll Want to Know: \nThe presentation and portion size of the dishes suggest they are begging to be shared, so don't be afraid to order two or three items per person. The menu is constantly evolving but remains true to tried and tested Italian classics, grouped into four categories:\n\nAntipasti - small appetizers, salads and light pasta dishes.\nPizzette - mouth watering personal pizzas, and calzones.\nSalumi - Italian charcuterie, like prosciutto, cacciatore, and bresaola\nFromaggi - traditional Italian cheeses like parmigiano reggiano, or burrata.\n\nGot a hot date and need to make great impression without breaking the bank? Dolcetto offers a fantastic Aperitivo Italiano for the 5 a 7. Wine, cheese, charcuterie and fresh baked focaccia for under $15. If you're looking to get acquainted with the full menu, ask the servers about the special dishes and cocktails. The daily specials are not to be overlooked as they take advantage of seasonal ingredients and the creative energy of head chef Marcelo Gonzalez and his enthusiastic team.", "business_id": "O5Wbhz5jH4VL70WNsYEGnw", "stars": 4, "date": "2013-10-25", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Daniel", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}, "user_id": "zhFLW0jlE11SXOYS5nzYGg", "review_id": "IDGXgKuUGUpuroXLnXb64A", "text": "We'd been looking for a great Italian place since we moved here and no luck.

Guys, follow my lead and get some points with your lady friends. A night at Dolcetto & Co guarantees good food, good drink, a comfy setting, AND you won't break the bank.*\n\nTypically, as soon as someone says 'small plates,' my mind's left the conversation. Why in the world would I want to pay for a dinner plate of food and get back something that could be served on a saucer plate? How does that make sense? To whoever thought of this scam, sir, I tip my hat to thee. It wasn't until an experience at Dolcetto & Co that I realized that my disdain may stem from an American perspective. D&C may serve small plates but said plates are packed with flavor, surprisingly portioned and easily sharable for two. Not once did I contemplate stabbing her hand with my fork in order to make sure I got a taste. Did I say that out loud?\n\nBecause I'm worldly, I opted for a cocktail over wine: bourbon & apple juice. It sounds odd but I'd been turned on to this combo in Miami Beach and, surprisingly, it works. Well. For the two of us, we had five dishes: eggplant with fontina cheese, prosciutto & mushrooms (heavenly), rabbit porketta (surprised I liked it; usually I'm not a fan of rabbit but this was the second time in Montreal I had it and liked it), Italian sausage pizza, the garlic shrimp with tomatoes & pancetta (good but nothing you haven't had before), and the lobster/fennell cannelloni (as decadent as you might imagine). The wood seating is tight for either a two top of a four top. I guess Montreal doesn't have the plus-sized population of the nation to its south. As much as I joke, I'm not a particularly large man and I had some difficulty navigating the space between tables. I imagine that for folks of a bit larger size, this could be an embarrassing issue.\n\n*I'm saying I'm cheap or anything but... small plates get expensive fast.", "business_id": "O5Wbhz5jH4VL70WNsYEGnw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-10", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Aria", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "CEBdujJn6e8_ErIBnxx1Sw", "review_id": "vXAnNUQgD3LKa29nEHId2w", "text": "Amazing and creative foods + lovely ambiance\n\nPlease note the meals are smaller than you expect :D", "business_id": "O5Wbhz5jH4VL70WNsYEGnw", "stars": 4, "date": "2014-08-19", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Natacha", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "8_rYiSRR83xl2Xz1uiN5SA", "review_id": "sO69YMi58XHmFSJH4VWcOg", "text": "Great place, great service.

Then came the homemade porchetta, a savoury, fatty, slightly salty & juicy slow roasted pork loin with crispy edges. Then we had the ultra-creamy gnocchi, little clouds of soft dough dumplings lightly doused in truffle oil. Following was the Lobster & Fennel Cannelloni, a true explosion of flavours and party in your mouth.And then there were the Pizzettes: small handmade pizzas with different toppings!

We were sat inches away from another couple, in an empty restaurant mind you, and then were rudely told by another staff member to move our table closer so that they could put another table on the other side of us. After about 10-15 minutes, a waitress finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered a spumante and prosecco, yet she had to check about 5 times with us to confirm. We were highly irritated by this, and at this point the waitstaff started moving tables on top of us, and pulling chairs from one side of the room to the other, essentially reorganizing the entire restaurant's set-up all the while talking loudly. Now this is a small and quaint restaurant, yet there were about 5 times the number of waitstaff than there were tables. I don't know how this restaurant is run, but I have never seen such a thing.

A potential jewel that is sadly lacking in its most important requirement- good food.  We were a group of 6 that tried various appetizers and pizzettes.  Firstly, the pizzettes are below average.  The most important aspect of any pizza-type creation is the crust.  If the crust is blah then you're already behind the 8 ball.  In this case, the crust is far too dry and hard which means it's cooked at a temperature that is too low and for too long.  The prosciutto and arugula version was horrific.  Both guys left it.  The cheese was not melted and the prosciutto was sliced so thickly that it was near impossible to eat- cold and chewy.  Prosciutto should be very very finely sliced so that it melts in the mouth. The ravioli seems to have been cooked hours before and then reheated in a pan with hard, dry edges and minimal flavour.  The Antipasto Misto plate is quite sparse for $30, as well as lacking variety- a tiny ball of burrata and some shaved pecorino with some prosciutto cotto and olives.  The gnocchi and lamb meatballs were only OK.\n\nFinally, the offerings are grossly overpriced.  These are tappas style portions which would be more appropriate at half to two thirds the pricing.

The \"regular\" (i.e. non-tart) yogurt flavors were just okay -  I would make the trip to Golden Spoon instead, as they have the best and most variety of flavors.

They have a nice selection of toppings (fresh fruit, nuts, cereal, mochi, some other British stuff I'd never heard of), although it's always a little scary having it self-serve (salad bar style) so it sits out for people to get their germs on your food.

The staff are always friendly, and alongside their lunch meals, all under a fiver, they have homemade cakes procured from a variety of local bakers, freshly ground Zapatista coffee, an assortment of teas and organic fizzy drinks. If you're out with family, the cafe provides a mishmash of children's toys to play with, so you can lounge and enjoy your food and drink (or join them). \n\nBecause of its location, the cafe is mostly open from spring, through the summer and into mid-autumn and its opening hours are often subject to the whims of the weather.

There are many honest and reasonably priced repair shops, this is not one.", "business_id": "YFvPti5GZjoIj1RV0EBsmg", "stars": 1, "date": "2016-02-04", "type": "review"}, {"username": "Jenna", "votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, "user_id": "AtwfAKlS-Hpf0HafDvqQww", "review_id": "72RCcF1Uu8Gukc3tVAAGtg", "text": "The mechanics at Greulich's are trustworthy and I've had nothing but good experiences in taking my car here.

Not reliable not honest.  Brought the vehicle in for one specific issue.  They did a diagnostic and with in trust decided to get this repair done that costed $$$ to find out that wasn't the issue.

First, they always get me in fast. Second, they don't mind if I bring my Mastiff along, which is awesome, b/c there are not too many places one can bring a 120 lb dog. But this place is dog friendly, which is important to me. Third (and 4th) they are reasonably priced, and have great service. For example, the other day one of my tires was going flat. I asked if I could pop in and have them check everything, and one tire was way under pressure, indicating a leak, but I was in a hurry and just asked if they could fill it up for now and I'd come back. The mechanic who specifically worked on it came up to me and said I had probably run over a nail and it was likely to starting losing air again so to please come back when I had more time. Sure enough, much later that evening, it was going flat again. I went back the next morning, and they patched it (I was happy to hear I did not need a new tire), and when I asked what I owed them, they said nothing! So, they essentially patched the tire for free, even though it did take them some time, they had to put the car up, remove the tire, find the hole, plug it -- the whole thing. But they were fast, kind, and then refused to charge me. Now maybe that's how all auto shops SHOULD be, but let's face it, they're not. They'll usually charge for everything, and over-charge at that. But I have found these guys to be just the opposite. They have serviced every car my husband and I have owned over the years, and they are always kind and honest. I can't tell you how much we appreciate that. They even buy Girl Scout cookies from my daughter every year, and like I mentioned, they are dog-friendly so really, you can't beat that (for me!) Love Greulich's, highly recommend them!! :-)", "business_id": "YFvPti5GZjoIj1RV0EBsmg", "stars": 5, "date": "2016-07-18", "type": "review"}], "state": "AZ", "longitude": -112.0121147, "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.6272318, "attributes": {"Accepts Credit Cards": true}, "type": "business", "categories": ["Auto Repair", "Automotive", "Tires"]}]
